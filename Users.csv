<p>No language makes perfect sense. — John McWhorter</p>

<p>Neurosis is always a substitute for legitimate suffering. — Carl Jung</p>

<p>To speak ill of others is a dishonest way of praising ourselves. Nothing is often a good thing to say, and always a clever thing to say. — Will Durant</p>

<p>A child educated only at school is an uneducated child. — George Santayana</p>

<p>Tactics is knowing what to do when there is something to do. Strategy is knowing what to do when there is nothing to do. — Savielly Tartakower</p>

<p>One of the painful things about our time is that those who feel certainty are stupid, and those with any imagination and understanding are filled with doubt and indecision — Bertrand Russell</p>

<p>Every good thing that happens in your life is a gift. — Yours Truly</p>

<p>If you can't practice self-denial, all you're left with is denial. — Ibid.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to disassociate language from science or science from
  language, because every natural science always involves three things:
  the sequence of phenomena on which the science is based, the abstract
  concepts which call these phenomena to mind, and the words in which
  the concepts are expressed. To call forth a concept, a word is needed;
  to portray a phenomenon, a concept is needed. All three mirror one and
  the same reality.</p>

<p>Antoine Lavoisier, 1789</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[L]ogic, in so far as it exhibits the universal and necessary laws of
  the understanding, must in these very laws present us with criteria of

<p>I've worked for more than 13 years, designing products for web ventures, from 3-person initiatives to medium-large industry. Strong Presentation and Negotiation Skills have been key to this work (in addition to the full monte; infrastructure, database design, core algorithms, scaling, backed and frontend frameworks, test-ability, compliance, and UI/UX + SEO). </p>

<p>I also design technology &amp; products by drawing from a history of fabrication, prototyping, sourcing, and scientific research (applied physics).  I am a practicing sculptor, and establish new product aesthetics via my own approach to engineering fluid-mechanical processes.  From this work in water, I have built a broad &amp; deep knowledge-base on the application of fluid phenomenon to industry needs.</p>

<p>I have lead successful small-capitalization stages, wrote grants &amp; engaged program officers, developed teams and timelines, design of experiments, measurement, and business development.</p>

Since February 2014, <strong>Ukraine has been suffering from Russia's armed invasion</strong> and attempted occupation.<br />
14,000 civillians <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/4r766hmm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">killed</a> Feb/2014-Feb/2022.<br />
100,000 <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/2rtefz22"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">killed</a> after the full-scale invasion on Feb/2022, incl. <strong>mass murders</strong> in <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/mpntn4zk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bucha</a> and <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/zddye26y"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mariupol</a>.<br />
<strong>1,900,000 forcibly deported</strong> to russia, incl <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/yc6v7bca"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">300,000 children</a>.<br />
6,900,000 refugees recorded across Europe.<br />
8,000,000 more internally displaced.</p>
<p>Invading Ukraine, however, is not the final goal for the Russian war in Europe. Their officials said numerous times: they are fighting against NATO. Ukraine is just &quot;lucky&quot; to be on their way.</p>
<h2>On their way to you.</h2>
<p>Read again: The final goal is you. Your house, your land, your history, your language, your freedom, your values. <strong>Your life.</strong><br />
If we fail to stop russians on Ukrainian soil, someone else (read: you) would have to stop them in Poland, Finland, Baltic states, and finally, on your backyard.</p>
<p>While there is no doubt that NATO can defend your land, think if you want to have a burning Russian tank in front of your home:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XQwCr.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XQwCr.jpg"" alt=""Bucha full of destroyed ru tanks"" /></a></p>
<p>Or a russian missile hits your house. You don't want to guess whether or not it is going to explode, do you?</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Afntk.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Afntk.jpg"" alt=""A ru missile hit a house in Derhachi"" /></a></p>
<p>Or if you want to become a &quot;collateral victim&quot; when a KGB terrorist assassinates someone using <strong>weapons of mass destruction</strong> in the center of your city.</p>
<p>Don't worry, the UN will express its &quot;deep concern&quot; about the loss of you.<br />
And even once-respected Stack Exchange network would <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/376743/187133"">find nothing better than say</a>, <em>&quot;well, okay, your death is a pity, but it's not a reason to ban the service on russias&quot;</em>.</p>
<h2>Your future depends on your actions <strong>NOW</strong>.</h2>
<p>Would you wait for russians come? Or would you act now?</p>
<ul>
<li>by calling your Senator to ensure more weapons to Ukraine?</li>
<li>by donating to Ukrainian volunteers?</li>
<li>by eliminating <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/2je9c4yc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">putinverstehers</a> in your politicum?</li>
<li>or, well, by stopping consuming russian propaganda (incl. reading some users here at SE network)?</li>
</ul>
<p>The world has to stay together to stop Russian metastasis in Europe as well as the Russian-equipped, Russian-trained, Russian-financed, and Russian-inspired terrorism all over the world.</p>
<p>Please help Ukraine defend you.<br />
Please <strong>Support Ukraine.</strong></p>

<p>Those who study God's laws to discern how to properly apply it in life are wise and flourish (<a href=""http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16222"" rel=""nofollow"">Psalm 1</a>).  When man's teaching negates, contradicts, distorts, or blurs God's instruction, it would be idolatry to place man's thoughts above God's.  We must obey God.  </p>

<p>In matters of discrepancy, we must obey the legal authority God appointed:
<a href=""http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9879"" rel=""nofollow"">Exodus 18:20-22</a> ""Men of substance, God fearers, men of truth, who hate monetary gain"" were to be appointed as judges in the land.  Moses was to teach the people the laws and teachings and ways of God. And these were to judge justly (<a href=""http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9965"" rel=""nofollow"">Deut 1:16</a>), righteously (<a href=""http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9980"" rel=""nofollow"">Deut 16:18</a>), and carefully (<a href=""http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9983"" rel=""nofollow"">Deut 19:18</a>). In controversy they shall stand as judges, and judge it according to My judgments. They shall keep My laws and My statutes in all My appointed meetings, and they shall hallow My Sabbaths (<a href=""http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16142"" rel=""nofollow"">Ezekiel 44:24</a>).</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9971"" rel=""nofollow"">In matters of discrepancy concerning the law</a>, the matter is to be brought before the priests, the Levites and the judge; they are to discern; and the people who brought the case are to submit to their judgement. To act contrary to their judgement is presumptuous and deserving of death. </p>

<p>Jewish people are chosen by God to be a holy nation, a royal priesthood, holy unto God, not unto man.  Among them, I see this holy calling most beautifully portrayed among the Karite Jews.   Their devotion is centered on God, their studies are focused upon Torah of God.  Their scholarship is articulate, thorough and precise.  Their exposition of Hebrew Scripture is outstanding and inspiring.</p>

Jay Cooke and Company, a large and respected banking house declares itself bankrupt, and announces its failure on September 18, 1873.. (The bank's collapse precipitates the ""Panic of 1873"" and the ensuing three yea depression during which more than 10,000 businesses fail.  
 
 The basic economic problems are overproduction, a declining market and deflation. Investors in Europe, where a depression is already underway, begin to call in American loans. The New York Stock Exchange closes its doors for 10 days; other businesses fail; and railroad construction is curtailed, with some railroads defaulting on their bonds. The unemployed begin to move about the country seeking jobs, and bread lines appear in the cities. The hard times drove numbers of laboring people and those in humble circumstances to the West and other portions of the country, to seek the rewards which the stagnation of business in the great commercial centre denied them.</p>

<p>I love to cook and I love to experiment. I have some small professional experience (chief cook and bottle washer), a certain little Alaskan town loved my dinner specials. I often think that I should have gone to culinary school, but I didn't. Maybe I'll audition for Masterchef someday. In the meantime, I'll continue to experiment. I love the internet.</p>

<p>Just in case you're here wondering what pronoun to use, I'm a ""she"".</p>

<p>Self-taught &quot;pajama genealogist&quot; since 2006. My formal training in data-handling comes by way of anthropological linguistics, which I studied as part of my master's degree in Linguistics.</p>
<p>My research interests are primarily focused on the 20th century and mid-to-late 19th century, mainly in New England and the South in the United States, and South Devon in England.  I prefer to call myself a family historian rather than a genealogist because I like to study an entire social group (a person's extended family, associates, neighbors) as well as the relations within the tight family circle. Since I enjoy analyzing other people's data as well as my own, 'micro-historian' might be a better description.</p>
<p>I enjoy working with primary sources, something that I didn't get to do when studying history in school.  To me the journey is not simply about filling in blanks on a group sheet. It is learning more about the times and places and how people lived: how their lives were different from mine, and how some things are still the same.  I enjoy talking about other people's research and brainstorming about different ways to search.</p>
<p>My toolkit includes Family Historian and Ancestral Sources, Behold, Scrivener and Scapple, Evidentia, GenSmarts, Clooz, and IrfanView.  Even with all these wonderful tools, I'm most likely to give you the same advice my high school calculus teacher gave me when we were starting to work a problem:  &quot;Get a piece of paper, and a piece of pencil, and draw a picture.&quot;  Stack Exchange is great because the act of writing everything out and constructing a good question is a wonderful way to engage with a problem and get a fresh perspective.</p>

<p>I have written about ""my personal terrifying experiences in Persia!!! as an archeologist"" My book is now available for Freshmen seminar with an instructor's guide for the 2014-2015 school year.</p>

<p>My personal interests are very diverse: Comparative religion- esp Muslim, Jews, and Christians; Semiotics, linguistics, philosophy of language, rhetoric and propaganda; History; Public health, esp. mental health. Although some of my experience is traditional, I also believe that art and literature are important to improving, understanding and solving modern mental health crises. I have used this with good results for old age dementia, but many find journals, painting, dance, ect very important for recovery from/ treatment for depression, autism, bipolar or other developmental or mental health problems.</p>

<p>If you read my contributions, you may notice that I am writing in an extremely
direct and open way which can be quite unnerving especially if you personally
are very polite or belong to a culture which values politeness. ""Yes"" means
<em>yes</em>, ""No"" means <em>no</em>, do not try to find hidden depths in the conversation.
Especially if I say negative things like ""This is wrong/incorrect"", do not see
it as personal attack. The easiest thing to cope with it is to imagine me
like a computer.</p>

<p>I have a more cynical, utilitaristic and pessimistic view and answers are modelled
by taking my own conclusions and experience gathered from other people. So some
earnest answers may clash with your preference for answers who sound good.
I see me more in the role of a narrator who has experienced many things, so do
not arrive at the conclusion that I actually follow or condone behavior described
in answers you disagree with.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin has not only invaded Ukraine, but he has begun an assault on the people in Ukraine's capital, Kiev.</p>
<p>Ukraine is viewed by the international community as entirely the victim in the current situation.</p>
<p>The entire free world is lining up against you.</p>
<p>Now imagine what is happening in Kiev as happening in Moscow - but instead of sending poorly armed and trained children to die, they are just sending missiles and bombs of all sizes.</p>
<p>To prevent this from happening, you must take to the streets or any channel you have the most influence with, and do everything in your power to contribute to the removal of Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Warmly and Sincerely,</p>
<p>Aaron Hall</p>
<p>Russian Translation via Google Translate:</p>
<h1>Дорогие русские люди</h1>
<p>Владимир Путин не только вторгся в Украину, но и начал наступление на людей в столице Украины Киеве.</p>
<p>Украина рассматривается международным сообществом исключительно как жертва сложившейся ситуации.</p>
<p>Весь свободный мир выстраивается против вас.</p>
<p>А теперь представьте, что происходит в Киеве, как это происходит в Москве - только вместо того, чтобы посылать на смерть плохо вооруженных и обученных детей, они просто посылают ракеты и бомбы всех размеров.</p>
<p>Чтобы этого не произошло, вы должны выйти на улицу или на любой канал, на который вы имеете наибольшее влияние, и сделать все, что в ваших силах, чтобы способствовать смещению Владимира Путина.</p>
<p>Тепло и искренне,</p>

He spent too many years writing software <em>just</em> for fun on the side while working retail to pay the bills. </p>

<p>Martin picked up professional experience working as a private contractor for Nocturnal Entertainment Australia on the Game Boy Advance title Ultimate Arcade Games. With a shiped title under his belt he attempted to move into a full time position in the industry but ultimately fell short. 
Disappointed, Martin decided to return to school to flesh out his skill set. In the process he discovered he enjoyed the problem solving and design of complex systems more than the game development. He graduated at(or nearly so) the top of his class at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with a degree in Computer Engineering. </p>

<p>Today he works on the Enterprise Management Technologies team at Quad/Graphics.</p>

<p>Many of these fancy web-design fads of the last years may be neat to look at the first few times, be it caroussels, infinite scroll, lazy loading or even (shriek) horizontal layouts, but then they suck from a user's point of view. E.g., with lazy loading one gets different results for incremental search, depending on how much has been scrolled over; crazyness. Also, many of those magick apparatuses destroy conversion rates, something that seems to not exist for a perceived 95%+ majority of webdesigners.

<p>I'm an economist by training. I've used LaTeX since 1991, ever since I wrote a couple of working papers with an early version of LaTeX. I continue to use LaTeX for my own working papers, journal articles, and some of my other professional publications.</p>
<p>I am the principal author of the <a href=""http://ctan.org/pkg/selnolig"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">selnolig package</a>, which lets LuaLaTeX users automatically suppress typographic ligatures that are inappropriate because they span morpheme boundaries, for both English and German language texts.</p>
<p>I once edited an entire conference proceedings volume in LaTeX. This was a fabulous learning experience, especially as I got to work closely with a professional book designer from a very early stage of the editing and publication process. For another organization I used to work for, I wrote a LaTeX package to implement the style and layout requirements the organization had chosen to impose on working papers written by its professional staff (mostly its economists). This package (i) helped free up much of the authors' time that would otherwise have been wasted on figuring out how to implement the organization's stylistic requirements in LaTeX -- the guidelines had been written (unsurprisingly...) primarily for users of MS Word -- and (ii) actually convinced some of the organization's economists to make the switch from MS Word to LaTeX in order to write their working papers more efficiently.</p>

My conversion story was originally published in the Baltimore Jewish Times and was reprinted in its entirety by <a href=""http://judaism.about.com/od/conversiontojudaism/a/baruch.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">About.com</a> and in excerpt form by Rabbi Maurice Lamm in his book <em>Becoming a Jew</em>.  I learned Daf Yomi for 10 years completing the entire 11th Cycle and getting half way through the 12th.  I stopped shortly after being diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease and recognized I could not stay up for late night Daf classes nor keep up if I did not.  For the 20th anniversary of my conversion, I decided to teach the last daf of Kesubos and contacted Art Scroll for help, as they had not yet published their translation of that daf.  Rabbi Yehezkel Danziger surprised me by suggesting that I try translating the page for publication in order to make my celebration ""more special.""  It took me 3 months to translate the main text and the Rashi, but I submitted my work and, after much editing, received an editorial credit in Volume III of Art Scroll's Kesuvos translation.  I have been a frequent contributor to the About.com Judaism board and specialized in counter-missionary posts.  My website, ""A Primer:  Why Jews Cannot Believe in Jesus"" is designed as a quick introduction to major points I tend to make when dealing with missionaries.  In my secular life, I am an attorney for the Federal Government.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For every natural phenomenon there are different levels of
explanation. I like to call these &quot;why&quot; values. For the first value of
why, the question &quot;Why is the sky blue?&quot; can be answered with some
simple hand-waving about light from the sun passing through our
planet's atmosphere. For a value of why + 2 (also known to parents as,
&quot;But whyyyyy?&quot;) you have to start talking about the fact that light
comes in different colors.</p>

is to bring a new dimension to artwork and storytelling. 
Technology, art and science are my tools, I believe in creating beauty and immersive interactive experiences and love the amazing extra dimension programming gives to not only me but to the user's, drawings are no longer static but have a logic and world of their own, with the user completing the artwork.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Learn, accept and move on.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;One doesn't need to know the answers, only the process of finding them.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;A more reliable and direct means of arriving at your destination is consistent triangulation between expectations, outcomes and objectives. &quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;An orientation of personality towards an “appraisal” is characterised by a yearning for rewards. It causes stress in case of the failure leading to the formation of a long-lasting fear. An orientation towards a “cause” shows itself in an interest in the subject-matter of the activity. It lessens stress caused by a competition and supports a long-term and successful occupation.&quot;</em></p>
<hr />
<p><em>&quot;People make mistakes in theoretical computation just as they do in numerical computation. It’s best when theory and numerical work validate each other.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;The question of whether computers can think is like the
question of whether submarines can swim.&quot;</em><br>
(Edsger W. Dijkstra)</p>
<p><em>&quot;There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is
to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And
the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no
obvious deficiencies.&quot;</em><br> (C.A.R. Hoare)</p>
<p><em>&quot;When I want to read something nice I sit down and write it.&quot;</em><br>(M. Twain)</p>
<p><em>&quot;All physicists and a good many quite respectable mathematicians are contemptuous about proof.&quot;</em><br>G. Hardy</p>

The focus instead seems to be veering from the technical to the social. This change in focus has come about through StackExchange Inc.'s increasingly heavy handed control. So I'll leave it to others to donate their labor to make the StackExchange venture capital unicorn dream come true, and hope that an open source, community run replacement materializes to fill the void.</p>

A lot of people doesn't like to help other, but seems to be here to collect reputation points. Downvoting, downvoting, downvoting, and closing questions... If you are a beginner in a topic, how to avoid asking noob questions? I wonder!!! This reputation point system prevents people to be more friendly. Neutrality is a lie.</p>
<p>The reason I still use it is that it teach me many things, because a lot of rude people, but some very specialized persons can be found here, and there's a lot to learn. It's the (very) positive side. There are some hidden treasures to learn many new things! I learned a lot.</p>

Currently I'm working in ELI-ALPS as a part of the PANOSC-VINYL, an EU-funded project aiming to develop a complete start-to-end photon and neutron beamline simulation system - including the simulation of source, propagation, sample, beam-matter interaction, and signal detection - as an open-source package in the framework of the Open Science initiative.</p>

<p>I’ve observed with interest, but have not participated in, the many meta-discussions surrounding a handful of issues lately.  These include the removal of IPS from HNQ, the changing of question vote rep levels, the retro-active switch of the CC version, and most especially, the case of Monica Cellio.</p>

<p>I found it all very upsetting, but for too long I chose to merely observe.  I did not change my avatar, did not change my user name, did not link to nor donate to the legal defense fund, did not answer or comment on the metas, and more or less continued as normal.  I am now ashamed of my lack of action these last few months, and it is time to change.</p>

<p>With the recent announcement of the agreement with Monica, and the phrasing of this announcement that clearly blames the victim, I must draw back from activities which might indicate I have even the slightest support for Stack Overflow.  I sincerely believe SO has committed criminal libel, violation of content license, and possibly other illegal acts.  Further, the leadership has acted in bad faith, and ignored the wishes of its user base.  Therefore, for the foreseeable future, my intentions are as follows.</p>

<p>I will:</p>

<ul>
<li>if while searching for the answer to an issue or obscure error, and
the result includes links to Stack Exchange sites, I will read these. 
Further, if the question and one or more answer prove useful, I will
up-vote as a thank-you to the posters;</li>
<li>check once in a while if I have received any new answers or comments to my old contributions, and provide a response as and when necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will not:</p>

<ul>
<li>ask or answer any questions, or comment on any questions or answers;</li>
<li>casually browse through questions and answers;</li>
<li>perform any reviews or related tasks, i.e. cast close votes;</li>
<li>display ""flair"" on my own website</li>
<li>continue to have the Stack Exchange App installed on any mobile devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>My anticipated timeline for this hiatus is the remainder of 2019 and all of 2020.  I may be persuaded to alter the timeline if I see definitive indications of change and contrition on the part of Stack Overflow and its leadership.</p>

<p>The CobaltDuck flocks with those who think this is <strong>wrong</strong>, and is flying south for a while.  Best Wishes to all my friends on the network.</p>

<p><strong>Up Voting Policy:</strong> My voting policy can be summed up in 3 words. <strong>Quotes get votes!</strong> I am more likely to vote for answers that are not only correct but also provide citations, quotes from original sources, and links. I often ignore answers that might be correct but provide nothing to back them up, or are mere speculation.</p>

<p><strong>Down Voting Policy:</strong> I rarely vote an answer or question down. I often prefer to leave a comment first so the person can improve their post. If they don't improve it after a few days, I may down-vote it for being off topic, provably incorrect, or rude.</p>

<p><strong>200 Point Limit Policy:</strong> I dislike that Stack-Exchange does not allow us to earn more than 200 points per day. When people get more than 200 points, this site caps them anything beyond 200 is lost. If somebody has a really good question or answer, they deserve every point they get. To get around that, I sometimes wait a few days after a popular question or answer is posted before up-voting it.</p>

<p><strong>Answer Policy:</strong> I choose answers to my questions based on which person best provides an informative and insightful answer. I am not interested in whether an answer is the longest or most popular, only that it is correct, on topic, and is backed by canon sources.</p>

<p>Here is another short list, a list of pet peeves I have collected on Stack Overflow and related websites:</p>

<h2>SI units</h2>

<p>To avoid ambiguities, there is a general consensus on how to format physical units. Please try to follow them, it helps the flow when reading, and it helps when trying to understand exactly what you are talking about. The official guidelines are offered in chapter 5 of the <a href=""http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SI brochure</a>, but there is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#Unit_symbols_and_the_values_of_quantities"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">summary</a> with a couple of examples on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>A particular problem is the <em>space</em> between the value and the unit, for example: 12&#8239;V, not 12V. A common hack is to use the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">non-breaking space</a>, <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>, to prevent the browser wrapping the line between the value and the unit. The problem with <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> is that it is often interpreted as a <em>fixed width</em> space, meaning that it will not render as the same width as a normal space, but wider. Unicode has solved this problem by introducing the <code>NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE</code> symbol, <code>&amp;#8239;</code>.</p>

<p>My recommendation is that you use <code>&amp;#8239;</code> to format SI units. This difference may or may not be visible in your browser:</p>

<ul>
<li>12 V (normal space)</li>
<li>12&nbsp;V (&amp;nbsp;)</li>
<li>12&#8239;V (&amp;#8239;)</li>
</ul>

<h2><em>""I'm in Europe.""</em></h2>

<p>This means <em>nothing</em>. Nothing at all to anyone trying to help you with a question you might have. Either write your <em>country</em>, or just leave it out - There's a world of difference (literally) between Turkey, Switzerland, Portugal, Romania, United Kingdom and Iceland. Different laws, different business structures, different traditions, different standards. The same goes for Asia.</p>

<p>Leaving out your country means that you will not get help with questions such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this legal?</li>
<li>Where can I buy things?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>If you need a few quotes by The Great Explainer, see below.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>I hate rigorous proofs, but I know they're good for me. Here's why:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.</h2>
  
  <p>Richard P. Feynman</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Examples don't only improve understanding, they help validate it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.</h2>
  
  <p>Richard P. Feynman</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>I'm an ignorant teen. Not to worry, for I'm a curious teen as well!</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>It is in the admission of ignorance and the admission of uncertainty that there is a hope for the continuous motion of human beings in some direction that doesn't get confined, permanently blocked, as it has so many times before in various periods in the history of man.</h2>
  
  <p>Richard P. Feynman</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>If your still on first principles like I am, don't feel too bad.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>If you keep proving stuff that others have done, getting confidence, increasing the complexities of your solutions - for the fun of it - then one day you'll turn around and discover that nobody actually did that one!</h2>
  
  <p>Richard P. Feynman</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>You haven't lived if you can't relate to this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>If I get stuck, I look at a book that tells me how someone else did it. I turn the pages, and then I say, 'Oh, I forgot that bit,' then close the book and carry on. Finally, after you've figured out how to do it, you read how they did it and find out how dumb your solution is and how much more clever and efficient theirs is!</h2>
  
  <p>Richard P. Feynman</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>I study like this, too:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>It's the way I study - to understand something by trying to work it out or, in other words, to understand something by creating it. Not creating it one hundred percent, of course; but taking a hint as to which direction to go but not remembering the details. These you work out for yourself.</h2>
  
  <p>Richard P. Feynman</p>

Posts created on this account during that time are a combination of both my official work and my personal opinions about how this platform works or could work.</p>
<p>While I wish I could have continued my time here, that was out of my hands when I was laid off with 28% of the company. I wish the best to my fellow CMs and I hope they're able to continue doing the best they can - as they already were. This is a wonderful place and there's so much potential if we can all work towards it together.</p>
<p>Prior to my time as a CM, I was a moderator on two of the network sites - Interpersonal Skills and Arts &amp; Crafts, both of which I supported from their launch dates until I was hired.</p>
<p>I have a degree in Radio-TV-Film and used to work in the film industry, mostly doing casting. Before that, I was a voice major, so I know how to make myself heard in loud places.</p>
<p>The small creatures in my profile image are my sons, Bennett (big) and August (little), and my hippo... Hippo (he's the grey one).</p>
<p>I've attempted a fair number of crafts from jewelry making to crochet and I also love to bake and cook... but mostly bake.</p>

<p>I like C#/VB.NET, love developing games (mostly roguelikes), but... umm... I'm yet to make something playable. I use Windows but seriously consider using a Linux too (but have trouble installing it :c).</p>

<p>I try to politely and carefully answer any questions there, because (I sincerely hope) I'm polite and kind by myself, and this community feels very warm, friendly and helpful, so I this is the least I can do to keep it that way and enchance it further. These qualities are rare from when I come from - people here are usually too cold and aggressive... It hurts me a lot. I hope things will get better though, but for now  this place remains one of a few friendly and helpful sanctums, aside from a few friendly circles of mine, which (more or less) share these thoughts too...</p>

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>I'm currently doing research with the <a href=""https://quantumdevices.berkeley.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Quantum Devices Group at Berkeley</a>.</p>
<p>Some personal projects include reading about spontaneous parametric down conversion and working on an experiment related to that - I've finished building a TEA laser, and am working on obtaining the crystals and other optics I need. I also finished the ideal half of a quantum computer simulator I'm working on - please feel free to try it out (it's on my GitHub)! I'm working on adding stuff that will simulate noise and decoherence in the qubits, and a few other features I'm planning.</p>
<p>I also recently fell down a delightful rabbit hole on shark intestines - turns out that <a href=""https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.1359"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the type of spiral intestine sharks have does not correlate to diet</a>, so I'm teaching myself R and parts of phylogenetics to try to test different hypotheses for what the different types of spirals correlate with.</p>
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>I always enjoy learning new things about Python and have been playing around with machine learning for a bit. I'm also starting to learn more about Lisp since parts of it were covered in a class I took in fall semester. I also enjoy DMing for a D&amp;D game I run. Currently reading through a collection of Marlowe's plays - Tamburlaine is <em>wild</em>.</p>

If one examines the structural paradigm of discourse, one is faced with a choice: either reject the semiotic paradigm of reality or conclude that the Constitution is part of the fatal flaw of culture.  However, textual desituationism suggests that reality <em>is capable of truth.</em><br />
The characteristic theme of dialectic dematerialism is the role of the observer as poet. However, we may deconstruct surrealism to conclude that “Sexual identity is dead,” as Marx said. But in fact it is the opposite:  rather the stasis, and eventually the economy, of sexual identity, that is not feeling so well.</p>

<p>The weapon of critique, however, cannot replace the critique of weapons; material violence must be overthrown by material violence; theory alone also becomes material violence as soon as it seizes the masses. Theory is able to seize the masses as soon as it demonstrates ad hominem, and it demonstrates ad hominem as soon as it becomes radical. To be radical is to seize the thing by the root. But the root for man is man himself.</p>

I like to solve olympiad-level math problems when I'm in the mood for it and I also dabble in coding from time to time. Writing is something I have a knack for.

<ul>
<li>Oracle TimesTen is a monster. Holy crap though, it is blazingly fast.</li>
<li>Guice is a beast which should only be used when you never want people to know where data is coming from. It could be justified by testing, but for the love of all that is holy QUIT MAKING SO MANY MODULES. You need like, 3, for a medium-sized project.</li>
<li>Mockito is amazing &lt;3</li>
<li>MySQL performs like a drunken elephant, but it's free and easy to use. Also, it's workbench is very nice, and I like it.</li>
<li>It is frustrating that most Linux developers act like Linux is the default environment for computers. If Linux is so superior, then why can't it (or at least most of the main utilities for Linux) handle even the most basic crap like a CRLF? Why don't people make many good video games for it? Is it more secure, or do Linux users just tend to actually follow basic security protocols?</li>

<p>The start of my programming career came from my time served in the US Army. I was a 25U - <em>Signal Support System Specialist</em>.<br>
While my job was based more on networking &amp; radios and didn't really have much to do with programming, my AIT instructor was familiar with C+ and that's ultimately where I became interested in the subject.</p>

<p>I like to draw. I like to write poems and stories. I love to do science. I also love to play the melodica.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>I came here as an unsuspecting 10th grader who wanted to share this revolutionary idea that the universe was a water tap. It was the result of several weeks of experimenting, theorizing, and making deep connections. Most of my classmates found it interesting, and some of them were so amazed at the level of my thinking. So I finally decided to disseminate this idea to the world through this site :)</p>
<p>That question didn't end up nicely, of course, but that was my first introduction to what science actually was. Like many millennials, I came to know about science due to the science shows they have on Nat geo and Discovery. And also those cool illustrated DK science books (<em>I love those DIY science experiments!</em>).</p>
<p>Truly, this site has been <strong>so</strong> influential in my life. From enabling me to see and feel science in everything around me, to helping me choose which path to take after school. I am now pursuing a PhD in Physics. I must say, this site has been a huge factor in giving me the courage to take up science.</p>
<h2>Nice resources</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><a href=""https://physlets.org/tracker/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tracker</a> is a nifty free software for extracting data points from a video. You have to select the points manually, but the final result will be worth the effort!</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://scratch.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scratch</a> is a brilliant program that lets you do almost anything (and it's free). I love to make physics simulations in Scratch.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://myscope.training/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Myscope</a> is an awesome resource for learning about different microscopy methods. They have good materials, assessments, and my favorite, cool virtual labs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Nice quotes:</h2>
<p><em><strong>Let noble thoughts come to us from every side</strong></em> - Rig Veda (<em>Also the motto of <a href=""http://www.bvbpottore.com/about.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my school</a></em>)</p>

She's made many good-faith offers to talk, and others have offered to mediate (and made <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=monica"">dozens of constructive suggestions on how to resolve the situation</a>). Several members of the Lavender community have spoken up on her behalf, e.g. in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336731"">this prominent post</a>.</p>

<p>So far, Stack Overflow, Inc. has met all of this with thunderous silence. As a long-time contributor and someone always willing to see the good in the company's and its employees' actions and assume good faith, I'm still struggling to come to terms with the corporate callousness of this behaviour which we have to assume now is the new normal.</p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336526"">Having exhausted all other means of communication,</a> Monica is now raising funds for potential legal action to clear her name. This is in her own interest, but arguably also in the interest of the SO community at large. While only the libel is likely to be legally actionable, it might establish at least <em>some</em> boundaries to what the company can do to its volunteers, as well as be a symbolic slap in the face of a business that appears to have lost all respect for the community that keeps it alive.</p>

<p>I have complete trust the funds will be used well and anything left over (say because they decide to do the right thing after all and legal action becomes unnecessary) will go toward good causes. </p>

<p><strong><em>Star Wars</em></strong></p>

<p>Been a huge fan of star wars ever since I watched the first trilogy. While other's paid attention to the wielding light-saber characters I was more focused on the famous bounty hunter ""Boba Fett"" with his famous mandalorian armor. I can say I've learned most of the lore of the mandalorian culture. </p>

<p>I'm very passionate about Star Wars, not just for the mandalorians, but the rest of the universe they are in. So let's talk about Jedi's, Sith, bounty hunters, or other things you might have in mind about this amazing universe.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Movies &amp; Series</em></strong></p>

<p>During my life I've watched tons of movies, series, and sometimes my memory get's a little jumble, but I can say my top trilogies are: Lord of the Rings &amp; Star Wars. BIG FAN of war/military like series it doesn't matter if it's current or medieval, I die for those kind of movies.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Comics, Mangas, Anime</em></strong></p>

<p>I was first introduced to comics by my childhood friend who gave me an old Star Wars comics, but after that in recent years my new friends showed me some animes they have watched, and I must say that, I got hook on the first show. </p>

<p>In recent month I decided to start reading more manga as that's where the source comes from. It feels way better to read the manga before actually watching the anime.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>History</em></strong></p>

<p>It has been my strongest lecture in my school days, always fascinated by what you learn about other places, and their rich story. My teacher's who taught me World history and other related courses have been a really big part of my life, because they have spark my love for history.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Sports</em></strong></p>

<p>If you have made it this far, I appreciate it. I watch all sports, but my favorite is football (soccer) love to watch any game from any league, and the team I support is <strong>Real Betis Balompie</strong> from La Liga.</p>

I also occasionally can be seen poking around other Stack Exchange sites (math is my specialty though), VGMaps, Pokémon Showdown, and spend a large time watching YouTube videos in a variety of STEM subjects or video games.</p>
<p>So far academically, I graduated from undergrad in the spring of 2019 and currently am in grad school. I also study topics on my own a fair bit, especially over breaks; recently, I've been studying from Apostol's <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em>. I still feel have a long way to go before I can call myself a &quot;master&quot; of any sort of mathematics, but if nothing else I feel like I have a quite broad knowledge pool that's stoked more interests than I can reasonably pursue in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Currently my personal inclinations lie towards algebraic topics (e.g. abstract algebra, category theory) but I've had quite an extensive look in analytic topics due to my coursework (especially real analysis, measure theory, functional analysis, and PDE theory). Ultimately, though, all math is cool and beautiful and I have a deep appreciation for all of it.</p>

<p>J’avais passé longtemps dans l’étude des sciences abstraites et le peu de communication qu’on en peut avoir m’en avait dégoûté. Quand j’ai commencé l’étude de l’homme, j’ai vu que ces sciences abstraites ne sont pas propres à l’homme, et que je m’égarais plus de ma condition en y pénétrant que les autres en l’ignorant. J’ai pardonné aux autres d’y peu savoir, mais j’ai cru trouver au moins bien des compagnons en l’étude de l’homme et que c’est le vrai étude qui lui est propre. J’ai été trompé. Il y en a encore moins qui l’étudient que la géométrie. Ce n’est que manque de savoir étudier cela qu’on cherche le reste. Mais n’est‑ce pas que ce n’est pas encore là la science que l’homme doit avoir, et qu’il lui est meilleur de s’ignorer pour être heureux.</p>

16491829,2020-08-02T16:15:31.097,Kristian Berry,41240,1,217,"<p>As far as I know, the axiom of the continuum (or: the initial instance of the infinitary powerset axiom scheme) is consistent with, but independent on, the axiom of choice. So it seems as if there should be a possible &quot;version&quot; of the continuum, the choiceless continuum (<strong>CC</strong>), which is not well-orderable. The <strong>CC</strong> is thus far similar to amorphous sets/cardinals, which subsist as topological determiners of their own; so there should be a set of topologies for/from the <strong>CC</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> is there anything contradictory about a continuum that at some times is subject to the choice axiom and at other times is not? Call this an <em>order-theoretically oscillating continuum</em>, or <em>orc</em> for short. I envisage at least two ways this might play out:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some temporal continuum starts in one state (well-ordered or coamorphous(?)) during the initial expansion, but that expansion's special incidence is occasioned by the continuum switching states, whereafter the continuum is fixed in the other state.</li>
<li>The orc is a proper orc, i.e. the oscillation is constant (and we have a pragmatic reason to use the word &quot;oscillation&quot;). <strong>In this event, though, if the oscillation was spaced out enough, would there be any way for us to empirically distinguish the choiceful from the choiceless periods?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Observation:</strong> I can dimly imagine a sort of (3):</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>The switch is stretched out over an infinite period of time (in a sense, the world's continuum is re-computed for 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × ... = ℵ<sub>0</sub>! = 2<sup>ℵ<sub>0</sub></sup> so that the &quot;second&quot; time the continuum is arithmetically generated, it switches to or from a choiceful/choiceless state). Or worse, if the continuum passes <em>to</em> an aleph-state at countable eternity, it is not as the continuum proper but the hypercontinuum of 2<sup>ℵ<sub>0</sub></sup>!, which after another infinitely long time turns into another coamorphous value, etc.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>Subproblem:</strong> if the number of possible particles in the universe changed when its continuum changed cardinality, it seems as if the conservation of substance would be undermined even if the number of particles lost/gained per period was incommensurate with the continuum's cardinality per period.</p>
<p><strong>(Co)amorphous infinitesimals:</strong> hyperreal infinitesimals are reciprocals of hyperreal infinite numbers, and surreal infinitesimals are reciprocals of transfinite ordinals. The base surreal example is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>ω</sub>, although there are then <sup>1</sup>/<sub>ω<sub>1</sub></sub> or <sup>1</sup>/<sub>ω<sub>/<sub>ω</sub></sub></sub>, etc., all the way to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>ORD</sub>. If (co)amorphous cardinals are infinite, do they have reciprocals? It seems as if there is a continuum composed of infinitesimals alongside the one composed of real-valued functions (whether this spawns another kind of orc, one which switches from infinitesimal to real-valued composition, IDK...).</p>

<p>Developing software through all stages, including testing and debugging, has given me a much greater appreciation for high-quality software development.  In particular, it has given me an appreciation for the best software engineer in history--God.  After all, He programmed us.  He wrote computer programs (in our brain) that could write other computer programs!  I'm so glad that He has provided a way for us to be forgiven of our sins by faith in Jesus Christ, His only Son, and the only way to Heaven.  Indeed, I can agree with David in the Bible when he says, ""I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.""</p>

<p>P.P.P.S. &quot;im&quot; isn't a word in English. If you want to be taken seriously as a professional, put some effort into your written communication. Find your shift key and the apostrophe and use them to properly spell the contraction of &quot;I am&quot;. It's not hard.</p>
