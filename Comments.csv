1735,1933,@DVK Sorry but it seems you did not get the idea. I asked about political/historical questions. It is not about which questions your experts are able to answer them as I can  be an expert about some of questions about my own country myself! But after taking a look at answers about Iran I found your experts have many bold problems so it shows this criteria to find which question is off topic or on topic is weird. Anyway my question is about something else. In simple words can you ask questions that your experts do not find it off topic by this pretext: It is political not historical?!,,0,2013-03-02T18:14:59.360,406,CC BY-SA 3.0

10214,120,"@Lucian: ""Guesstimates"" are used in military operations sometimes. For instance, there is a military axiom that an attacker needs a three to one (numerical) superiority to capture a fort (a guesstimate). Grant had 3 to 2. So did the gunboats provide a force multiplier of 2 to get him to 3 to 1 (answers are likely taught in the military academies. Simpler formulas: Did the men on the gunboats bring Grant's strength up to 3 to 1? Did the gunboats' cannon added to Grant's cannon divided by the Confederate's cannon amount to 3 to 1. The answers to the latter questions are part of the ""record.""",,0,2021-10-19T13:02:38.710,4319,CC BY-SA 4.0
