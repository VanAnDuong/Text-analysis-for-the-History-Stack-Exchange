<p>Firstly, I disagree that the <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/5169?phase=definition"">proposal in Area 51</a> made it clear that it was purely geo-pol as questions #4, 5, 6 and 7 all being non-geo-pol. I am personally not interested in geo political history, apart from finding it boring, I think most of the meat is available on wikipedia e.g. Where was such and such treaty signed.</p>

<p>If this is correct we may as well start up an ancient-history and local-history sites.</p>

<p>So what does everyone think. Private beta is the right time to decide. Then all off-topic questions should be closed to send a clear message.</p>

<p>What are the boundaries for this site?</p>

<p>Note also that local history was brought up as part of discussion in the definition phase and nobody said it was off topic.</p>

I think what Robert was trying to say with this phrase, while a misnomer, is actual academic history, the like you would learn in your average (for better or worse) college history class. Academic is the key word here simply because it belies an air of legitimacy that is vital in the early stages of this site.</p>

<p>Questions asking about the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/85/was-the-granny-smith-apple-the-first-green-skinned-apple-widely-propagated"">history of a certain breed of apple</a> and further derivatives are not history questions. The question referenced lacks an academic historical air to it and is instead asking the history of a certain <em>breed</em> of plant. Were this question focusing less on breed and more on economic implication of the trade of apples (or cod, or salt, or, or, or) then yes, it would be academically viable. In this case it is far from it and better suited to <a href=""http://Gardening.stackexchange.com"">Gardening.SE</a>. </p>

<p>Again, I feel that ""Geo-Political"" here is a misnomer.

<p>Your observations and concerns are spot on. This History Stack Exchange &mdash; while it is still <em>really</em> early in the beta &mdash; has <em>exactly</em> the problems faced by the (now defunct) ""<a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/15025/how-things-work"">How Things Work</a>"" Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>The downfall of the How Things Work site was that it was little more than regurgitated content. Users would find and post common ""How Things Work"" questions&hellip; followed by users competing to be the first to cut-and-paste the ""standard"" answer from a well-known source.</p>

<p>Even as a complete layman, <strong>I know <em>exactly</em> where to find the answers to about 80% of the questions on this site.</strong> This is what we call a ""General Reference"" problem. It's that feeling you get when a 12-year old asks you how to spell ""trivia."" You  want to grab them by the collar and say <em>""Look it up, you lazy&mdash;""</em></p>

<p>I honestly don't know what an <em>expert</em> historian does all day, but I'm quite sure <strong>they don't sit around quoting encyclopedia articles</strong>. There must be finer points of history to discuss: </p>

<ul>
<li>Help with research</li>
<li>Analyzing documentary evidence</li>
<li>Exploring apparent bias </li>
</ul>

<p>&hellip;that would be a start.</p>

<p>If the history experts on this site don't have problems to solve that aren't already well-documented in ""General Reference"" sources, this site has already failed. We don't need a site that adds another level of indirection between the question and the cited answer. That's why the ""How Things Work"" site was closed down.</p>

<p><a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11/could-questions-here-be-too-localized/20#20"">I made already the suggestion to tag historically, not only thematically</a>.</p>

<p>Another thing i would like to discuss/suggest is <strong>putting a timestamp on every question</strong> (where we know exactly the century). </p>

<p>So, e.g. every question on WW1/2 gets tagged with a <strong><code>20th</code> timestamp</strong> (for conventions on historical dating look <a href=""http://courses.wcupa.edu/jones/his101/misc/dates.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Century means per definition a time frame of 100 years, while notations like BCE-CE lack this implicit time range. Imho a century is a good historical scale and well suited for tagging. </p>

<p>A Problem arises for dates BC, either negative centuries or we leave out tagging with centuries there and refer to epoch as suggested in my first link.</p>

<p><strong>Profit?</strong></p>

<p>This could get a quite nice tool for prof. experts/students but of course also enthusiasts like most here to search easily what happend within a specified time frame and region by using powerful stackexchange search syntax, e.g. <code>+[18th]+[19th] napoleon battle</code></p>

<p>Using <strong>tag-synomys</strong> we could match distinct questions then with epochs/eras, e.g. <code>+[middle ages] +battle</code> (all tags from 4th - 15th) to see all battles in a epoch. Neither Google or Wikipedia can do similar and it would be unique selling proposition.</p>

<p>The lack of mechanical assistance to this endeavor also leads me to have low expectations on the success of such double-tagging in practice when the site is opened up. You are likely to have users who will only use the event tag, rather than the period/century tag, which would require a lot of upkeep on the community to maintain proper tagging. Without constant vigilance and maintenance, it will quickly result that questions with the event tags will not always have the corresponding period/century tag, and vice versa.</p>

<hr>

<p>An alternate option that is available is to provide custom tag sets through the <a href=""http://stackexchange.com"">http://stackexchange.com</a> <code>tagged questions</code> section. You can create a tag filter that would select, say, all of the events pertinent to a particular period or century. So for example, you would include <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ww1"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ww1&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ww1</a>, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ww2"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ww2&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ww2</a>, and <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cold-war"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;cold-war&#39;"" rel=""tag"">cold-war</a> (I know there's more to history than wars, but those were 3 easy picks) under the ""20th century"" tag filter, and similar filters for other centuries. You could also group events or centuries with particular periods like the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Tag filters can then be subscribed to, by email or by RSS feed, to allow for monitoring in a similar fashion as with favorite tags. Though, one unfortunately cannot search within the subset of these tags automatically.</p>

<h2>What is this site about?</h2>
<p>Generally, Stack Exchange sites are built for academics and experts to solve specific problems you encounter in you day-to-day work.  It's been suggested that since &quot;History&quot; is a chronological account of events past, there are really <strong>no <em>problems</em> to solve</strong>, per se. It's a bunch of reference material for your to look up and share.</p>
<p>If that ^^^ statement above doesn't make your blood boil, <strong>we're probably building this site for the wrong audience.</strong></p>
<p>History is <em>not</em> about asking about past events. The <em>FIELD</em> of history (to an expert <em>historian</em>) is about scholars who examine and analyze events and perform objective investigations, determine cause and effect, look for apparent biases, etc.</p>
<h2>Is this site about history trivia?</h2>
<p>We've already talked about answers that just regurgitate content from other sources (<a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3/warning-about-answers-that-just-copy-online-sources"">Warning about answers that just copy online sources</a>). But the <em>actual</em> problem is not that answers are being copied… It's that the <strong>questions solicit answers that are <em>eminently</em> copyable.</strong> Many of the questions sound as though they're written by students the night before their essays are due.</p>
<p>I honestly don't know what an expert historian does all day, but I'm quite sure they don't sit around quoting encyclopedia articles. So my question is this…</p>
<h2>Finally, a question…</h2>
<p>I'll make this a free-for-all, pile-in-your-thoughts question on any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are <em>you</em> getting out of this site?</li>
<li>Why should it exist?</li>
<li>What purpose does it serve and how does it make the Internet better?</li>
<li>Do we need to re-scope this site to appeal to the more academic nature of historians and historical study?</li>
</ul>
<p>If the history experts on this site don't have problems to solve that aren't already well-documented in &quot;General Reference&quot; sources, this site has already failed. We don't need a site that only adds another level of indirection between the question and the cited answer. We need a site that does something more.</p>
<p>What is that &quot;something more&quot;?</p>

<p>Yep. Blood boiling ;)</p>

<p><strong>What are you getting out of this site?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>It is fun. Researching questions that I wouldn't have ordinarily have thought about is awesome.</li>
<li>I am working on a <a href=""http://www.cannonade.net/ww2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">collaborative project</a> to map historical conflicts in time and space. Sometimes the Internet <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/46/where-was-the-pre-war-ww2-border-between-poland-and-germany"">fails to deliver</a> accurate geographical information in all cases. I see this StackExchange as a way to get answers to my questions and to add those missing pieces of information to the Internet.</li>
<li>I want to pillage the personal libraries of strangers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why should it exist, what purpose does it serve, how does it make the Internet better?</strong></p>

<p>This follows my last point on the previous question. Books are stubbon things. They give up their knowledge when you pull them from the shelf and pry them open, they require you to be in the same geographical location and they fail to be indexed by Googlebots. </p>

<p>In the past few days I have dug some interesting pieces of information from my personal library and added it to the Internet:</p>

<p>Prior to this <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/26/what-led-to-the-first-fight-in-the-american-civil-war/69#69"">answer</a>, Lincoln's inaugural address existed on the Internet, but without this particular context in mind.</p>

<p>Before this question, the Internet's <a href=""http://www.google.com.au/search?gcx=c&amp;ix=c1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=When%20and%20Why%20was%20the%20samurai%20class%20abolished"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">response</a> to '<em>When and Why was the samurai class abolished</em>' talks about the fact with little concern for the reasons. This <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/120/when-and-why-was-the-samurai-class-abolished/162#162"">answer</a> makes the connection to to the Meiji Restoration's Charter Oath, which previously <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_Oath"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">existed</a> on the Internet without that context (and with a different translation).</p>

<p>These are examples of knowledge and context that was previously hidden away in books and now exist online and we have more <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/12/who-if-any-in-jfks-inner-circle-argued-against-the-plans-for-the-bay-of-pigs"">work to do</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How can we, potentially, re-scope this site to appeal to the more academic nature of historians and historical study?</strong></p>

<p>I was ready to rant that we need to be more aggressive about closing questions that can be answered trivially on Wikipedia, but looking at the home page this morning, I don't see any questions like that. I have only suggested closing <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/230/when-was-the-last-cavalry-charge"">one question</a> in the private beta and even that proved to be ambiguous.</p>

<p>I agree 100% we want to attract historians to the site, but I am not sure we are doing any thing right now that would preclude that.</p>

<p>Given my personal historical projects over the last few years I have had a need for good quality history Q&amp;A. I have tried most of the other Q&amp;A platforms with this purpose in mind. I went as far as to compare Mahalo &amp; Vark.com for a particular question, they both failed to deliver a satisfactory answer. </p>

<p>They failed because they lacked the laser focus of a community that have books about history on their shelves. This site <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/46/where-was-the-pre-war-ww2-border-between-poland-and-germany"">succeeded</a> where those other sites <a href=""http://www.mahalo.com/answers/i-am-looking-for-latitude-longitude-data-for-the-1939-german-polish-border"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">failed</a>. </p>

<h2>What are <em>you</em> getting out of this site? </h2>

<p>It is fun. Seriously, I haven't asked a single question so far - yet I learned lots of things about history that I didn't know before. It was mostly details that history books didn't consider important enough. Yet these details help you truly understand an epoch.</p>

<h2>Why should it exist?</h2>

<p>IMHO the best answers on this site are the ones that show the large picture and put well-known events into a far less known context. Sure, each single fact is usually already available online. But finding the connection between them and explaining how it all fits together - that's something that even many history books fail on.</p>

<p>For example, we all know that machine guns and similar technical advances made <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/230/when-was-the-last-cavalry-charge"">cavalry attacks</a> and <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/308/when-were-swords-last-used-in-european-warfare"">cold weapons</a> useless in modern warfare. But it couldn't have happened overnight. So when did this change actually happen? How long did various armies hold onto them and why? Now we know.</p>

<h2>What purpose does it serve and how does it make the Internet better?</h2>

<p>Some questions are <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/71/why-did-hitler-attack-the-soviet-union-when-he-was-still-busy-fighting-britain"">far too complicated to be researched in full here</a>. Still, bringing together the different points of view and discussing them does create value because everywhere else you get one point of view and no alternatives. Oh, and I changed my opinion into the exact opposite after researching that question - oops...</p>

<p>But sometimes we seem to dig up something that is genuinely new. Up until now if you asked which Confederate state contributed the most soldiers to the army you were bound to end up with North Carolina. <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/169/which-confederate-state-provided-the-most-troops-in-the-american-civil-war/394#394"">Here</a> we don't only have the correct answer and an explanation as to why the numbers are unreliable, but also the most likely source of the North Carolina theory - some facts have been put together than only existed separately before.</p>

<h2>Do we need to re-scope this site to appeal to the more academic nature of historians and historical study?</h2>

<p>I don't think that it is a problem of scope. Some questions are simply already well-researched, e.g. <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/365/first-recorded-use-of-aerial-weapons-in-warfare"">history of flight</a>. This is bound to result in lame answers that mostly point to the (easily found) references. As with other SE sites, we need to require research effort here - including showing where you already tried to find the answer.</p>

The 'how things work' site closed down because the answer process became a race to regurgitate existing content online.</p>

<p>I think this analogy to our site isn't valid. I tried out a few questions that I imagine would have turned up on that StackExchange:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>Now lets look a Google results for our three <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes"">most popular questions</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.google.com.au/search?gcx=c&amp;ix=c1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Why%20did%20Hitler%20attack%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20when%20he%20was%20still%20busy%20fighting%20Britain?"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Why did Hitler attack the Soviet Union when he was still busy

</ul>

<p>Looking at the google results for each of these in turn:</p>

<p><strong>Why did Hitler attack the Soviet Union when he was still busy fighting Britain?</strong></p>

<p>Google gives us a biography of Stalin, a fairly impenetrable CIA article about what Stalin knew prior to Barbarossa and a post on the Battle for Berlin. Dig a bit further and you will find content that gets close to answering question, but in horrible <a href=""http://www.onwar.com/articles/9901.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pre-StackExchange type sites</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Why didn't Imperial Japan attack the Soviet Union during World War 2?</strong></p>

<p>From the first result:</p>

<pre><code>Warning: array_merge() [function.array-merge]: Argument #1 is not an array in [path]/archive/global.php(40) : eval()'d code on line 118
</code></pre>

<p>Followed by an adsense block and then some forum results. The second result is the Hirohito Wikipedia article (getting closer but no cigar) and the third result (I think we have a winner) is a list of alternate fiction.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any proof that Robin Hood existed?</strong></p>

<p>This is certainly the best of the lot, an article on Wikipedia followed by various other fairly credible posts on the history of Robin Hood.</p>

<p><strong>My conclusion is that the analogy isn't valid</strong></p>

<p>So the point of this analysis? Two of our three best questions have terrible results on Google. The answers we have are clear, provide a new analytical perspective and, I think, do a good job of answering their respective questions.</p>

<p>If our answers were available on the Internet we would be adding very real value. If this was baseball we would be world champions.</p>

<p>Compare this to my 'how things work' examples, the results are pretty straightforward and there already exists sites devoted to this particular vertical. This is a solved problem. </p>

<p>History Q&amp;A is not a solved problem (believe me, I have looked). </p>

<p>What do you think? </p>

<p>These questions, although the most popular, probably aren't the best examples from the site (and they are still beating Google). I think there are many more examples (some of which I noted in my answer to <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/users/30/robert-cartaino"">Robert's</a> question). </p>

<p>If you have other examples were we have added something awesome to the Internet (that wasn't answered before), post them here. I think we need to clearly demonstrate the value we are creating.</p>

<p>Yes, there are limitations to how much we can expect from a closed beta.

<p>This is not to say that some fact being in Wikipedia revokes its eligibility as a question.

It is in the nature of history that there are large uncertainties. There are some events that can be considered a fact: they were confirmed by multiple independent sources so we are mostly sure that they indeed happened. On the other end of the scale are events that <em>might</em> have happened but there is little to no actual evidence that they did (or even indirect evidence suggesting that they didn't). Your questions tend to target the uncertain end of the scale and you expect definitive answers - this isn't going to work.</p>

<p>Say for example, somebody asked ""Did Caesar plan to invade America?"" The only possible answer to this question is: ""very unlikely"". But one can of course spin a theory about some Roman ships that sailed for Egypt but accidentally got to the New World (it <em>could</em> have happened, right?), left no evidence of them being there, got back safely and managed to tell Caesar about their discovery. Which prompted Caesar to think about a military campaign, without leaving any written evidence of course. Unlikely? Yes. Possible to disprove? Since we don't have a letter from Caesar stating ""I never wanted to invade America and I didn't even know it existed"" - probably not.</p>

<p>You can always spin a theory to ""prove"" any point you like which is why such theories aren't quite well-seen by people with serious interest in history. This explains some of the negative votes you got.</p>

As participants in this site, we need to be sure to carefully source our answers and attempt to follow some basic historical methodology. I see this on some answers, but then again I see other answers where people make assertions and don't properly back any of them up. Since I almost always wasn't there in the time/place the answerer is talking about, I have no basis to know whether or not what they say is true. I am therefore skeptical of all History and want to see the proof behind someone's answer. As someone with a degree in History, I have a harder time seeing professional History experts taking the site seriously unless we can provide decent backing to assuage reader's skepticism.</p>

<p>So I envision a good History SE answer to be very similar to a <a href=""https://skeptics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1023/faq-what-makes-an-answer-good-on-skeptics-se"">good Skeptics SE</a> answer. To summarize their points</p>

  <ul>
  <li>It must actually answer the question.</li>
  <li>It must be factual, not based in speculation.</li>
  <li>Every answer must have one or more references.</li>
  <li>Its references must support the argument, and should be verifiable.</li>
  <li>It must be written in a polite and neutral tone.</li>
  <li>It must be written in an accessible vocabulary.</li>

<p>I would however be less strict on the <a href=""https://skeptics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5/faq-must-all-answers-be-referenced"">""no original research""</a> as I think its a great idea to include some analysis of primary source material in History.SE questions. </p>

<p>How we provide references should be a little specific to History SE based on commonly accepted historical methodology. To back up our answers, I think we should encourage the use of (1) relevant primary source material (quotes from participants, archeological findings, etc) and (2) Works by historians who are experts in fields related to the answer. We should discourage citing Wikipedia and other tertiary sources. Wikipedia may be useful when writing an answer to get at good historical works through their citations, or it may be ok to link in some tangential information, but we should discourage the citation of Wikipedia to directly backup claims. Claims should be backed up with concrete stuff that happened in the past that you can point to, not a Wikipedia page.</p>

<p>I've seen some answers that are great, weigh different pieces of evidence from important sources. I've unfortunately seen other answers that are lacking, contain a simple link to a Wikipedia page, or a blatant statement of fact not backed up by anything other than maybe what Wikipedia said.</p>

<p>I'm not bashing on Wikipedia, I just want to know more. What sources are being relied upon for the information in Wikipedia? What biases/problems might those sources have? Are there confirming sources? What do the experts say? Whats their basis for thinking that?</p>

<p>This example shows that relying solely on the community to sort such things out will not work. Some arguments sound convincing enough to collect some upvotes - but that doesn't make them reasonable. And leaving such answers around, with upvotes and even accepted (because the OP is into conspiracy theories himself) will undermine any respect that this site might gain.</p>

<p>I think that we should flag such answers. Indeed, I've done that with the following explanation:</p>

  the sources available, not willing to share any sources that support
  these statements.</p>

<p>While requiring sources for everything might go too far, we should definitely ask for sources when we see statements that aren't obvious or common knowledge (meaning: not verified by a simple Google search).

<p>It would be nice if we could automate this process, e.g. have a flag ""sources missing"" that would add a comment ""Your answer makes claims that aren't supported by any sources, please edit it to add them"".

<ol>
<li><p>It can easily be looked up in the Wikipedia article on <em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus"" rel=""nofollow"">Columbus</a></em>. However, you need to scroll down and probably read some parts that do not answer the question before you <strong>find the part that answers it</strong>.

To turn someone away solely based on the notion that their question covers ground that has been contaminated by conspiracy theorists is (imho) a poor philosophy. So merely involving a conspiracy theory should not be, by itself, criteria for closing. They are after all part of history.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as we know conspiracy theories only persist through willful ignorance of fact, reason, and science, on which our historical knowledge and study is based on, just like every other discipline. So if the person asking the question is also willfully ignorant of these things, there is nothing we can do for them and should either close the question or, at best, flag it for migration to Skeptics (which I currently feel should be criteria for a predefined migration path via close vote, but it's still too early to tell that for sure).</p>

<p>We should expect SOME crossover between Skeptics and this; that is no different than most sites having some crossover. Some sites (consider Unix/Linux and Ubuntu and Server Fault) have a considerable amount of crossover. I expect this and Skepetics to have some crossover and we will simply have to deal with that.</p>

This question says <strong>""Can we safely assume these do not belong on the site in any form?

<ul>
<li>""How should we define a conspiracy question?""</li>
<li>""How should we define an off topic conspiracy question?""</li>
<li>""How should we distinguish between off topic conspiracy questions to close and those to migrate?""</li>
<li>""How does Skeptics.SE handle conspiracy questions and what can we learn from their experience?""</li>

<p>I also agree about lessening the restriction on original research. As a moderator on another SE site, I saw someone answering questions that often mentioned the product he writes and sells. At first I was like ""ugh, this guy is peddling his product"" but after reading a post or two, I realized he was a very smart man who had researched his topic very, very thoroughly and was able to use his experience to help solve peoples problems. Then at the end he kindly put ""I solved this problem, and a few more, with my tool -yada yada-"". If I would have dismissed his original research right then, three or four people that week would have had a tougher time with serious problems they were facing at work.</p>

<p>But this is uniquely different than Skeptics. To the best of my knowledge (and I stand to be corrected) <strong>there are no professional degrees, certifications, or other recognitions in ConspiracyTheoryOlogy""</strong>. While there are certainly plenty who devote their life to analyzing conspiracy theories (images of guys with huge bushy beards living in trailers in the mountains or underground bunkers come to mind) none of them are accredited by a university or professional trade organization or anything of the sort.</p>

<p>We should take any original research from a non-professional with a grain of salt as amateur. This is not to say completely dismiss it, but to keep in mind that it did indeed come from an amateur. On Skeptics, due to the lack of any non-amateur by definition, it is very easy to say ""This will get out of hand, so we will require sources in all instances.""</p>

<p>However, we should also point out that Wikipedia does allow for research published elsewhere (journals, websites, etc) to edit the content to include as long as it's done so fairly. This fairness is enforced by the community who constantly review each page (which if you actually look, even the 'forgotten' pages have a fairly recent last update date!!) I imagine if someone on the Skeptics site had published an article in a professional and recognized science journal that they would be able to cite it, and perhaps even include other evidence not published there, based on their obvious professional and expert status.</p>

<p>Here, with the number of professionals we have (and certainly hope to have) we should keep original research on a long leash. That is to say, not unbounded. There should be an expectation that original research is either called out (on SO and other sites, I often put [citation needed] in the comments, especially when someone's like ""Java is slow, use assembly, man!"" or some other unfounded claim) or backed up by professional credentials. I would not be comfortable with someone being both professional and anonymous. If you want me to trust your original, unpublished research on THIS topic, I want to see your original <em>published</em> research on other topics. In other words, I want to see credible evidence of your ability to perform meaningful research.</p>

<p>In short, laying down guidelines of what is and isn't allowed for original research will help us remain objective. If someone crosses what we define as the guidelines, we can gently point them here (and ideally this would belong in the FAQ, which we know all members of online communities read before they post, right? Right?!)</p>

I can see the value in such answers, as starting research in a new area can be very daunting, particularly with a broad topic or one with answers scattered through books on more general topics. Also when I come to history.SX I'm not likely to have an identical question as someone else, but if I have a similar one then the list of references could be very useful.</p>

<p>For example, I'm starting an essay on German Rearmament. I don't want people to give me information on my essay topic outright, but I would love to have some of the more knowledgeable people point me to where to find books on it, as such topics are scattered; I've got books on the end of the Wimer republic, the start of WWII, military history and the road to total war. I'm positive I'm missing good sources, and have a number of chaff book sin my pile, and being able to ask for help would be <em>really</em> useful, as well as beneficial to anyone else working on the same topic.</p>

<p>I'm having trouble finding examples right now, but <a href=""https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/12174/naming-latex-files-best-practice"">Naming LaTeX Files</a> is a clear example of a clear, but open-ended, question, as is <a href=""https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/19263/what-are-the-finishing-touches-you-put-to-a-document"">What are the finishing touches you put to a document?</a></p>

<p>I think having them as questions is much more useful then in chat, as it is far easier to search for questions on the same/similar topics when a new person comes along then it is in chat. Chat also has the risk of no one available to help, especially as we grow, then answers do.</p>

<p>Finally if I'm out and about and see a question asking about, say, the British Army leading up to WWI, I can say 'Oh hey, I just wrote an essay on that, I'll grab my sources list for them when I get some time' -I'm not going to do that if they ask in chat, and I don't see them online again.</p>

<p>I <em>would</em> say that we need to restrict such questions to narrow topics: ""I'm looking for sources on the British Army in the years leading up to WWI"" or ""1850-1914"" for example, not ""What are a list of good books on the British Army?""</p>

<p>On cerberus answer:</p>

<p>while we all probably not disagree here that it is a used term in historical sciences, I still don't think its useful for searching and also takes away one tag from the <strong>maximum tag number (5 is few for such a broad topic like history)</strong>. I used on all of my questinos 4-5 tags and imho 2 time-tags should be maximum.</p>

<p>If we consequently now tag all questions here belonging to ancient history (covering several milleniums till middle ages), <strong>probably 50% of the questoins here can be tagged ""ancient history""</strong>. Then the tag isn't really useful anymore for searching, the topic of the question is always explained in the question title anyway. It's like a ""script languages"" or ""ancient philosophy"" tag, it covers too many times in too many diff. places, but no historical topics, developments belonging/influencing to each other. <strong>Do we need three time tags like ancient history, roman empire, 2nd century.</strong> This is imho redundant. And cerberus examples just show to me that everybody understands ancient differently. <strong>A tag should be clear and specific</strong>. A tag is not a definition, we use them on stackexchange for a working subscription and searching system, not to categorize by definitions historians made. <strong>If we would have a maximum number of tags of 8-10, I have no problem, but I fear and hope the history.SE gets really big and alot of questions and there is some reason why SE sites ""only"" have 5 tags and it will not be changed in near future</strong></p>

The century tags give you exact periods. World War 2 happened at a very specific time. The Middle Ages, while disputed on the exact length at times, are still a very specific period of time that is defined as being that time. These all work as tags because when someone looks at that period, they know when it is supposed to be.</p>

<p>The existence of this question is evidence to the contrary when it comes to periods where their definition is <em>relative to the current period</em>. <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ancient-history"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ancient-history&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ancient-history</a> is actually more problematic because of its nebulous nature - when does ancient start?

Early modern extends how far back? In a few years, does it still count as early modern, will we have to <em>remove</em> tags?</p>

<p>Tags are not meant to be dynamically changing - they're intended to be a static descriptor that helps you strongly identify what a question is about. If a tag's validity is affected by the passage of time because it is relative to present day, then it is extremely suspect as a tag. This kind of effect is a bit more visible on other sites like Gaming, where we have ""old-games"" and ""retro-games"" tags that just no one is sure what counts as that because of how fast the game generations span out. On History, it'll take centuries to affect things like <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ancient-history"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ancient-history&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ancient-history</a>, but it still is far more useful if there is a more definitive descriptor about the actual era in question.</p>

<p>&quot;Ancient History&quot; is actually quite a clear period: from the dawn of history (defined as that time from which we have written sources) until the Middle Ages, so <strong>ca. 500</strong>. The precise date of a period is rarely clear, and this is no exception; but it isn't any <em>less</em> clear than the Middle Ages or the Renaissance or the (Early) Modern Era.

The term is most often used of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Antiquity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Classical Antiquity</a>, the classical civilizations of the Mediterranean, especially Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome.</p>

<p>I agree that perhaps Contemporary History (1800–present) will become obsolete eventually; but it will perhaps outlast this website, and the term is common among historians. I'd prefer &quot;19th Century&quot; and &quot;20th Century&quot; as tags for that.</p>

<p>My additional points as one of the close voters (it became a bit longer to link to similar questions in future):</p>

<p>I don't see much value and necessity for such questions here, because we will mainly rebuild book recommendations you can already find on amazon, wikipedia discussion,... I don't know why the recommendations here would be better and more objective. Funnily, in the accepted answer of your question, you state that the reviews for one book aren't good (?) In the end you seem to trust mainly the (amazon ?) review anyway (?) Either you trust the amazon or the SE rating...</p>

<p>Also it's a bit problematic to give out reputation for such questions, so making every one a community wiki would imho be the only option. But stackexchange is no wiki and cw questions the exception of the rule as far as I know.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Use the excellent search and tagging system here to search questions you are interested in, look for given sources in the upvoted answers or ask one of the answerers in this question via @user in comment or chat for a recommendation. The voting system here will mainly rebuild what most people have read, obviously this does not have to be the best and most detailed book (you are looking for).</strong></p>

<p>On mathoverflow: they have much less questions of this kind, so it's probably ok, reading a lot books is much more important in history, so we would probably get a lot more questions of this kind here. Also, please consider while many prof. experts on mathoverflow will love a book, you might lack any background or ability of abstract thinking to enjoy and understand that book. That's why we have special books for newbies, pupils, students, experts... these questions which book is the best are really pointless without stating what your background and current knowledge is imho and why internet is full of such questions. Every fact book has to fit a special audience to become successful, if not, there wouldn't be so much different books on the same topic. Economically proven ;)</p>

<p>PS: Any (book) question on SE containing ""best"" in title without stating exact needs and personal background is likely to get my close &amp; downvote because of above explained ""mechanisms"". SE is for specific answers fitting specific questions. For ""best"" and ""most popular questions visit reddit.com. Don't take this personally. </p>

<p>Basic problem:</p>

<p><strong>You could be skeptical about everything in history</strong>. ""Did this really happen?"" ""Is it true that...?"" Often answerable by Wikipedia/other sources. History.SE is about explaining developments, of course proving and gathering facts is the main work of a historian, but not his final goal. <strong>Historians try to see the bigger picture.</strong></p>

<p>Also, I think both sites would profitate from each other, if questions/answers link to each other for explaining developments vs. proving single facts.</p>

<p>Reasons to migrate to Skeptics.SE:</p>

<ul>
<li>Proving/Disproving of facts, <strong>existence of historical proofs</strong> (Did Holocaust really happen, Did people really walk on the moon, 9/11...)</li>
<li>Questions about <strong>statements</strong> of single persons (which mostly do not cause/start/influence historical(politcal/social) developments, perhaps some notes/book written by this person does, but then, just read that book, e.g. Karl Marx)</li>
<li>the answer will likely be mono-causal, a <strong>single but important fact often debunks a conspiracy theory</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Reasons to migrate to History.SE:</p>

<ul>
<li>the question asks about historical <strong>developments/situation</strong> (thats what historical science is about, explaining and understanding coherently developments on <strong>time scales of years and generations</strong>)</li>
<li>the answer has not to prove/disprove facts, but to name all significant ones &amp; put them in a correct chronological order, <strong>explaining development based on a historical(social/cultural/economical) context at that specific time</strong></li>
<li>the answer will be multi-causal and rather tries to explain rather than to prove, as historical sciences often deal with incomplete information and have to use plausibility and exclusion methods</li>

This seems rather similar to the recent contest among the sites that did not really work, so I am not sure what the difference here is going to be.

<p>How it works: We will designate one topic each week, and each person who asks a question relating to that topic will be eligible to win a prize.</p>

<p>How to enter: Ask a question relating to the topic of the week, and tag it accordingly (this week, use the ""ww1"" tag). Each question you ask will get you one entry into a random drawing to win a book of your choice (under $50). It can be a book about the topic that week, or anything else you've been wanting to read! Paperback, hardcover, or books for e-readers like Kindle are all fine.</p>

<p>Choosing the topic of the week: For this first week, we decided to go with WW1 (see the discussion <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/140/would-you-be-interested-in-a-war-week-contest"">here</a>). But for all following weeks we want to take suggestions from you! It can be a war, time period, or any other significant historical event. Leave your suggestion as an answer to this meta post, and the topic that is voted the highest at the end of each round will be the topic of the following week.</p>

<p>Each round will be announced Monday morning at approximately 10 am EST.</p>

<p><strong>[Edit]</strong>: World War 1 Week is now over. Congratulations to DVK for winning! We don't have a topic picked for the next contest yet, so if you have suggestions, please leave them as answers to this meta post.</p>

But I couldn't find that question anywhere. The closest question was <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/897/why-study-our-countrys-history"">this one</a>, which was closed because of its argumentative nature.</p>

<p>That is the problem with this question - I think it can be very argumentative. But it is also fundamental to the field of history. I am new to this SE; I spend most of my time at MathSE or PhilSE. At MathSE, this type of question would (and has) survive if formulated properly. At PhilSE, it would not (I think). I think this is due to the continued use and support of use of Community Wiki (CW) for questions that are of questionable content, despite the general trend at SO to phase CW out. This, in turn, I attribute to the fact that MathSE has an incredibly large and active user base, so a few questions can be tossed in even if they do not fit perfectly within the SOP of the SE model.</p>

<p>Perhaps I find the idea of asking a question about 'why studying history is useful' due to my background as a mathematician. As a mathematician, people often ask me why we bother studying math to the extent that we do (e.g. what do we ever do with geometry? Who really uses calculus, and why should high schoolers learn it? And so on...), and I answer it all the time. I suspect that historians can do the same.</p>

<p>So how should I formulate a question, addressing the importance of studying history, so that it will be acceptable on this SE?</p>

<p>When I say ""professional historian"" it's somewhat loose - e.g. you hold a degree/concentration in History/Anthropology/related discipline, or you teach it, or you have published works that can be classified as historical research.</p>

<p>P.S. It's mostly idle curiosity about the site demographics, no specific purpose in my asking. </p>

<p>One possible use for the info might be to be able to ask targeted questions aimed at areas where we KNOW we have experts, which should generate high quality answers that would improve the site overall IMHO.</p>

<p>For example let't take the question ""when did WWII started?"" If the questioner seeks for a school answer, the official date from Wiki is enough. But he or she could be interested in the deeper understanding. Was Czechoslovakian annexe a real start? Or that of Czechoslovakians border regions after Munich? Or Austria annexe? Or, on the contrary, the war in Poland was only the preparation and the real start was in Norway, where really the Germans began the battle with one of the future winners? Or the June of 1941, when the sides were finally set? Wiki doesn't know the answer, it only could help with some information.</p>

<p>So, I would set it otherwards. We could make a new tag, as ""official history"" or ""homework"" and if a question has it, the questioner needs the explanation on the schoolbook level. And let's not refuse a good answer for him or her. Children also need help. Maybe, the explanation in wiki on the question is too complicated for them. But if there is not such tag in the question, we should take it that the author seeks for a deeper knowledge and wiki could be taken only as one of many secondary sources.    </p>

<li><p>An <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/1223/332"">answer</a> which <strong>did NOT answer the question</strong> (the answer was a one-liner stating results of revolutions, whereas the questioner asked about the comparison of the causes). <strong>As  appears to be the pattern, not referenced either.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>An <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/1381/332"">answer</a> about recent events (debatable if the question is of good quality or even good fit on History.SE as any answer is too localized for now due to recentness of events).

<p>First, the history has not yet been settled. The closer you are on the timeline to what it is you are asking about the more obfuscated the question, and answer, are by politics and uncertainty. Many of the questions about history concern cause and effect and we simply don't fully yet know the long term effects of things close to us.</p>

<p>Second, what is or isn't historically relevant has not yet been determined. Although the pressing political issues of our day may seem to be overwhelmingly important they could in fact turn out to be not that big of a deal when future generations look back upon our time period. Simply put we do not know what the future will deem important about our time. We can forecast all we want but then we aren't really engaging in historical analysis.</p>

<p>Those are my two cents on the issue, but really current events, are not as easily analyzed as historical events, which of course come with their own host of issues (sources, viewpoint bias, complexity) that make them almost as difficult to analyze.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the line between creating <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/131/does-history-se-want-skeptics-ses-attribution-questions"">fairy tales/fiction and real history is often very thin</a>, and so it becomes really hard for the voters to vote the most plausible and best referenced answers (""what if/why not"" scenarios have no references, they didn't happen :) )</p></li>
<li><p>without a clear scope these questions are more likely to create discussion then specific answers on specific questions</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Pros: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>These questions seem a popular line of reasoning (<a href=""https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/49390/term-for-finding-correct-solution-by-excluding-wrong-solutions"">process of elimination</a>) when trying to understand historical developments (probably even among prof. historians).  ""Would scenario Y not have been more likely to happen, given the conditions at this time?"" etc. Though, you will probably not find them in an scientific paper or book, as it is mosty rather speculation, based on hypothetical assumptions.</p></li>
<li><p>It looks like (correct me) that often newcomer to this site ask those questions and we would drive them away (<a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/5169/history"">more visits/questions per day</a>) by hard and fast down &amp; close votes. So the regulars should close vote this questions if they are poor explained and keep them in the vote ranking below our top quality questions with down votes. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Criterions (I would use for close vote):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>pretty hypothetical assumptions in the question text</p></li>
<li><p>is it reasonable based on known facts that the proposed fictional scenario of the questioner could have happened? He should give some facts/wikipedia links in the question text.</p></li>
<li><p>If we close a lot of those questions (we should point the newbies in the comments to a meta thread or accepted ""what if"" questions)</p></li>

<p>An example of a bad question was something like ""Why did the British sell opium to China instead of savva ganga? (since deleted). The latter never entered the picture historically, so the author was really asking, ""could the British have pursued their ""mercantile"" policies using a less harmful drug?"" as opposed to ""Why didn't the British pursue another, comparably viable alternative?""</p>

<p>On the other hand, I know of at least one widely contemplated scenario of how the Axis could have won World War II (absent timely U.S. intervention), which I discussed in an answer.</p>

<p>So a less subjective wording of the question might be, ""are there any widely contemplated scenarios featuring an Axis victory in World War II?"" Since the answer to this objective question is yes, this ""what if"" question is a ""good subjective"" question.</p>

<p>After some thought I concluded that the whole maneuver would have succeeded even IF the southern prong had failed. This hypothetical is grounded in surrounding facts: 1) the Germans had their chance to stop the southern prong and chose not to do so. 2) The Manstein relief expedition (from the south) failed in large part because Hitler had ordered Paulus to remain in Stalingrad rather than head south for a link-up/breakout.</p>

""X is the likely cause of Y"" or ""if X had occurred, Y would be more likely to have resulted"").  The mentioned post is a good example of the problem of what if questions as they ignore larger historical forces (economic, popular, cultural, etc) and focus on ""accident of history"" type responses.  Such responses place undue weight on individual actors over the aforementioned historical forces which are a far more potent influence on their actions and thus of far more interest.  Furthermore, the resulting debate would be unfocused as where with a specific hypothesis, a more productive and interesting debate would follow.</p>

<p>It is obvious from the long list of questions asked in the post linked to by the asker are not so much historical questions as they are questions on specific military tactics of that particular age.  While there is a historical component to these tactics, many of these questions lack clear answers to the larger question asked (ie. ""could the axis powers have won if X?"") and will virtually always lack clear answers.  This is because there is a myriad of potential variables which could intervene that go well beyond any particular tactical or even strategic decision.</p>

<p>Even in the context of a specific military engagement there is always the countering question of what other actors would have done in response, which is often difficult to answer.  Even if a logical outcome can be determined based on a specific tactic, it then becomes necessary to explain how this would effect the larger environment and in such a fashion more and more speculation is required.  It is more conducive to a productive historical debate to isolate a variable <i>to the highest degree possible</i>.  What if questions effectively do the opposite. </p>

Also, as it should be obvious from the variety of answers, virtually every revolution and rebellion had a philosophical justification outlined in a document like Tom Paine's <em>Common Sense</em> or Voltaire's <em>Declaration of the Rights of Man</em>, and educational works like those mentioned in <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/1531/742"">Sardathrion's answer</a> and <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/1530/742"">mgb's answer</a>.    </p>

It is the voting and comments to improve questions that help the site, nasty comments and personal attacks don't enhance the questions and/or answers.</p>

<p>History is very interpretive, looking at each incident means having an open mind and thinking of the events that led there.  Each person will also have their own unique view on events and incidents, if you do not agree and you can't find a way to enhance the question then leave it.  Of course if a question needs improvement then feel free to vote down and comment why you think the question needs improvement, the comments help everyone.</p>

<p>Keep an open mind as more people with different viewpoints and different experiences will come here, its a place to learn not to attack.  If you have a way to improve questions that isn't apparent, feel free to suggest them.</p>

If anyone has any suggestions on how we can increase the number of regular site visitors, then please share that with us. Thanks!</p>

<p>There are five specific criteria they use to measure the success of each site, and we are doing ""okay"" in 3 of the 5. Below is a current summary, but <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/5169/history"">this link</a> will allow you to monitor our status in real time moving forward.</p>

<ul>
<li>Questions per day - Currently at 2.9, 15 per day is considered a healthy beta.</li>
<li>Percentage answered - Currently at 94%, which is excellent, with 90% the goal.</li>
<li>Number of users - Currently have 112 avid and 938 total. This is considered okay, but we need 150 users with 200+ rep (we have 112), 10 users with 2000+ rep (we have 9), and 5 users with 3000+ rep (we have 3).</li>
<li>Answer ratio - Currently at 1.9, but the goal is 2.5 answers per question. </li>
<li>Visits per day - Currently at 341, and the goal is 1500. </li>
</ul>

<p>The first and last items both need a LOT of work, while the others are acceptable. If we can't improve considerably on the two bad ones, then this site will end up being dropped along with the others that didn't meet expectations. </p>

<p>BTW - We have some people who are close to crossing over into the higher thresholds, but they cna't get there if we don't have folks voting up their answers/questions. There are a lot of things we can do to get all our numbers up, and if we don't then we are going to lose the site.</p>

<p>I want to ask the stackexchange mods (e.g. @shog9), if they can give us a hint, if this site shows a good or bad traffic trend? All the stats are nice, unfortunately most don't look to often on them or keep track of how they change. </p>

<p>As far as I read some of the currently closed sites showed a traffic decline, less questions doesn't seem to be main problem, considering there are <a href=""http://non-beta%20sites%20with%20around%203-5%20questions/day"" rel=""nofollow"">non-beta sites with around 3-5 questions per day</a>.</p>

<p>What this site distinguishes from the closed ones is the amount of user with middle and high reputation putting effort into the site, very good answer ratio, healthy voting and meta discussion. </p>

<p>I'm a member of german.se, similar questions per day ratio for long time, but our traffic afaik grows slowly &amp; constantly as the user number.</p>

<p>I think the only real problem (legitimating a close) our site currently shows is lack of advertising and many history-geeks being more interested in their local history and debating/googling it in their national language. At least in Germany we have a lot of hobby archeologists etc, smaller history forums. Funnily, covering worldwide history often poorly and not showing interesting questions from people from the other side of the globe makes me often watch history.se. It's the most international history forum I know. If this site gets closed I will probably shut down my participation in many of the smaller stackexchange niche beta sites with similar stats.</p>

<p>So I would really like to see a comment/answer by the SE mods where we stand, simply shutting down sites without a warning, while other with very similar stats are kept open leaves me a bit perplexed. </p>

<p>Also showing a bit more history.se questions on the front page would be fair. I don't know what the criterions are for putting a question on the <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/questions"">http://stackexchange.com/questions</a> site. But I never see a history.se question, but often very boring (to me) questions on simple english or mathematics problems with dozens of answers, more traffic (as these sites started earlier). I'm not sure the system is very fair here in sense of advertising new and smaller beta sites...</p>

My understanding is that SE evolved out of computer related questions and it would correlate with the way in which questions here are asked and answered.  I'm not necessarily saying that it the format is unworkable for history and other subjects, but it doesn't feel like it was designed for it.  Particularly, in subjects like history debate is an important part of the subject (granted this is to a lesser extent true in technical subjects, but you can't argue with the BSoD).  I'm surprised that the chat function hasn't been used here in 83 days, but I suppose that has to do with the lack of traffic.</p>

<p>Which leads me to my next point.  I think the bigger issue is that most of the people involved in SE, from my experience, seem to be people who have some sort of technical background.  They were ultimately drawn in from SE proper, CS, or similar sites.  Obviously this puts us at a disadvantage as experts in history are less likely to come to our corner of SE as opposed to say network professionals to the technical side of SE.  As an activist most of my friends graduated in social sciences and non-technical disciplines such as literature, my friends who are history majors have never heard of SE.  I don't know if this has properly been taken in to consideration.</p>

I was wondering what we could do to improve the site's performance.  Here are some thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We seem to be suffering from a lack of experts.  It seems like we should reach out to people who have an academic background in history.  It's good that we are getting quite a few people, like myself, who have an active interest in history, but no academic credentials, but it would certainly be good to have people who have devoted their careers to the study.  I don't know if this has been considered, but maybe we should reach out to the various history departments throughout the world?  It would be really nifty if professors asked questions here for their students to participate in.  This seems like a good example of us being able to use the ""technical-fetishism"" displayed by many academic institutions to our benefit.  Also, I'd imagine that many professors would have an inclination to help us advance the spread of historical interest.</p></li>
<li><p>Not only do we lack experts, as <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/204/742"">Hauser notes in TED's thread</a>, we also lack diversity in interest.  Again this could be improved by reaching out to institutions or various groups that have an interest in a specific historical field.  It would be nice if we could implement specialty into the site's mechanics, possibly by letting users select one or two historical fields to specialize in (or automatically selecting a specialty for users based on the tags of questions they answered, possibly modified by the reputation attached to each answer).  We could also have incentives for having uncommon specialties such as providing badges or incentive bonuses for a certain amount of posts for uncommon tags.             </p></li>
<li><p>I don't know if this has been considered or if it's necessarily a good idea, but maybe offering users similar incentives as the above mentioned point for directing users to the site?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway just some things to consider.  I'd love to hear what you guys think.</p>

<p>If you look over <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/5169/history"">our stats on Area 51</a>, the common thread running though everything sub-optimal there appears to be that we simply don't have enough people participating yet. Presumably we didn't get axed because the situation hasn't stagnated, so I'm guessing (hoping) things are on a slow rise.</p>

<p>Given that, I'd think the best thing that one could do to help the site out would be to get it out there more. The best way I can think of to do that is to link to questions (when appropriate of course), on other forums, websites, chat services, etc. which you might hang out on. That should help the site's page-rank.</p>

<p>These days when I have an issue with a programming facility and do a Google search, quite often an appropriate page on Stackoverflow pops up in the top 5 hits. That's what we need to be happening for history questions people search on.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update: 
It appears that sometime in the next day or so I'm quite likely to graduate to the 3000+ rep realm (becoming our 5th such user, which will hopefully take that part of our stats green). Just to make sure the 1000-2999 range stays green too, I found our closest member, which turned out to be <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/users/512/rose-ames"">Rose-Ames</a>, and voted up a couple of her eminently worthy answers. :-)</p>

<hr>

<p>Update (December 6, 2012):</p>

<p>We are now down to only <strong>one</strong> ""Needs Work"" area, and it is way higher than it used to be. We only have two that are meerly ""OK"", and they both seem to be on the upswing as well. We need to keep things moving in the right direction, but I'm no longer particularly worried about closure.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update (January 24, 2013)</p>

<p>We now have <em>no</em> ""Needs Work areas, and two of our three that are meerly ""OK"" are within shouting distance of the green ""Excellent"" range. This includes the most important one IMHO, Visits Per Day, which is 85% of the way to the magic green 1,500 mark. Its possible the other may be a temporary blip up into ""OK"" range, but if we keeps our Visits Per Day this high, I suspect it will stick.</p>

It would be good to get more questions here, and I am making it a goal to add more on topics I have been looking into, and to me that is part of it, participation.  Both on the question AND answer front, many of the people on the site have added questions and answers, some one and some the other.  Adding to either will help us out on stats.</p>

<p>Voting will help, as TED notes, since getting more participants with Rep helps us out, but I admit to being as discriminating as TED about who I vote up.  Much as I want to see us succeed, since this site has become my main participation space I don't want that effort to go to waste.  Previously SE did have a contest to get more questions to the site but that didn't really garner much, but I think WWI might have been a difficult choice, at least for me - but then it also falls into the area of Military History that Sigue mentioned.  My concentrations were on Colonial American and Chinese-Japanese history so there are many questions I wouldn't feel qualified to answer without study, it'd be nice to know who focuses on what area.</p>

<p>I do not know about many experts that we might get, strangely many of my history professors in college I have seen recently were still not really using technology much in the classroom or their personal lives.  It might be best to get college students who are majoring in History interested, especially those who might go on to MA's who might be able to add their specialization.  Current students tend to be more acclimated to technology and be more willing to utilize online sites like here.  I'll have to see about more promotion of the site in my alumni network for those who might be interested.</p>

The <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/faq"">FAQ</a> very prominently says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You should only ask practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I came across some questions where the asker is very explicit about the actual problem they're facing, such as the ones on “<a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/648/what-was-the-life-expectancy-in-medieval-britain"">What was the life expectancy in Medieval Britain?</a>” and on “<a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/1135/how-to-research-controversial-history"">How to research controversial history?</a>”. But there are few such questions. Most questions don't mention what problem the asker is facing at all. Given that these questions weren't closed as off-topic, or that nobody asked for clarification on the problem (with some <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/2025/united-states-incarceration-rate"">exceptions</a>), I'm wondering why the above guideline is (still) so prominent in the FAQ. Shouldn't this guideline be given less prominence, or be reworded somehow? Or conversely, should people be asked more often to clarify what problem they are facing?</p>

I've been withholding because I'm not sure <em>how</em> to vote. An up vote can express a few different things, such as “insightful!”, “well-written!”, “funny!”, “made me think!” or “well-researched!”. I see there's been some discussion about whether answers should provide <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1/should-we-include-sources-in-answers"">sources</a>/<a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/99/our-answers-need-to-be-more-like-skeptic-ses-answers"">references</a>, and personally I think on a site dealing with history they really should. Especially since, if I understand the answers to <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/236/why-does-the-faq-prominently-ask-for-questions-based-on-actual-problems-that-yo"">my earlier question</a> correctly, this site is not supposed to be a problem-oriented SE site where answers are mostly evaluated on their helpfulness, but an understanding-oriented SE site where answers are mostly evaluated on their accuracy. This puts me in a dilemma when seeing the many answers on this site that do seem “insightful” or “well-written” but which do not seem particularly “well-researched” because they don't provide any references. Should I up-vote anyway or withhold completely? It makes me wish I could do something like cast a half vote to incentivize the answerer to further improve the answer by providing references.</p>

<p>So I have two questions really: (1) Should there be some way, that is not tangled up in the many different things an up vote can express, to incentivize answerers to provide well-researched answers? (2) If so, I assume an addition like half votes or any other site-specific mechanism (“scholarship ratings”?) is unlikely to be added to the SE software, but is there something else that could be done? The cooking SE site is providing encouragement by <a href=""https://cooking.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1296/"">doing weekly prizes</a>, which is at least one idea.</p>

<p>It is a shame to see this happen, because the question has considerable merit and deserves to be a part of this site. It is the responsibility of the community to help police this site, so if you see an answer that is clearly inaccurate or is totally unrelated to the question at hand, then downvote the answer.

<p>However, comments that are directed at the person asking the question or others who have commented are not going to be tolerated. Personally, I feel that some of the negative votes were not justified and the explanations were weak, but I'll let them stand.</p>

My reason for suggesting this is because 1) the comments will not be displayed anyway, and 2) if we get this many comments, then we need to look at other options, such as the Meta area or, preferably, the chat room. Any time we find ourselves having a lengthy discussion in the comments area, it really should be moved over to chat.</p>

<p>As far as the time frame, I believe we have to option of one hour, one day, one week, or permanently. I chose one week for this particular question because I wanted to give everyone time to calm down and consider other options (like chat), and I also wanted to give people time to see what was going on and use this question as an example. </p>

<p>I didn't want to lock it permanently because we are not allowed to vote, andswer, or comment on any question that is locked. This question deserves to be here,a nd I feel that it will merit additional voting. Furthermore, I believe there are still other possible answers out there, so I didn't wnat to lock it indefinitely. </p>

<p>I would also like to remind people that you should vote a question or answer down because it doesn't have merit, is poorly worded, is off topic, or generally just doesn't belong here. I didn't see any comments for the question itself to indicate reasons for voting it down, and that is unfortunate because I feel that althought the question could be worded a little better to make it more appropriate, it is still a valid and pertinent question.</p>

However, it appears that our visits per day and questions per day simply are not increasing enough. In fact after a recent spike they are now slowly falling back down. <strong>Perhaps, by allowing a trial week for easier questions we could see the impact it may have on our site.</strong> I believe that there are a plethora of historical questions that any one person may have throughout the day, and nearly 700 of the them can be answered here quite well. For the average person the majority of their questions can be answered on wikipedia with answers that generally include source(s), but in a way is lacking the human element/discussion. There are many other Q&amp;A sites that are decent (at best) in the answers provided. I am really beginning to feel that in order to generate site usage and site popularity (search engine results) we need to <strong>worry less about the question asked and more about the elite answer provided</strong>. Our biggest advantage may be our ability to provide <strong>multiple elite answers</strong> along with the <strong>human element</strong> provided within discussion (comment/chat). We as a site likely do lack historical knowledge in some arena, but with the site being recognized more and more via increased results in popular search engine we may quickly recover in those areas.</p>

<p>The crux of the matter is that a hard question is likely to have gone through the process of...</p>

<ol>
<li>checking to make sure wikipedia doesn't provide an answer</li>
<li>is not a top search result in popular search engines</li>
<li>hasn't been asked yet on our site.</li>
</ol>

<p>This process <em>can</em> impact our site negatively in two ways. First and the more obvious, we don't get another question. The second is a bit less obvious, but a person who took the time to check other popular resources is much more likely to be led to the answer on their own. This is true for even questions that aren't answered on wikipedia or other popular places. This may be good for that person, but bad for us. Potentially that <strong>question could have drawn attention to our site, created internal interest from our current users, and even spawned additional questions on that particular topic</strong>. Of course one could say that we should ask it anyway, and I would suggest that it is likely that some of us who are regulars on History.SE have likely done just that. However, for someone who stumbles across History.SE or even becomes a new user may not post their original question. Worse yet, they may feel in over their head as they read our previous questions. We have a list of <strong>very respectable questions</strong>, many of which are difficult/advanced questions, but one could assume this has made some potential users feel a bit uncomfortable. </p>

<p>In response to some of the comments below, I would like to remind everyone that ALL Stack Exchange sites follow the same guidelines. Your questions need to be formatted in a way that they are able to be answered with a clear and concise answer. Questions that ask <em>WHY</em> are always going to be subjective by the very nature of the question. Everyone will have their own opinion as to <em>WHY</em> something happened. </p>

<p>On the other hand, questions that ask <em>WHEN, WHO, WHAT</em>, and often <em>HOW</em> are going to be much more likely to be answerable with a clear and concise answer that does NOT require speculation, conjecture, or opinion. If your questions do not follow these guidelines, then it is our responsibility as a community to close them.</p>

<p>For one thing, I think the above was a perfectly valid question. I used to wonder the same thing, until I read Rise and Fall of the Third Reich and came across where the name came from, and some of how it was justified at the time. IMHO the cheif tactical error that question made was to pose it in present tense, rather than past tense. If they'd fixed that, I bet nobody would have complained.</p>

<p>There are a fair number of questions I see posted that are about modern-day events and are essentially political or sociology questions, not proper history questions. If there were SE sites covering those topics, we could just shunt them off there and be done with them. In the absence of a Sociology.SE though, I suppose you could view History as Sociology carried out on past events and peoples. There's nothing stopping a person (eg: us) from using the same analysis tools on today's events we use on past ones. </p>

<p>We could instead say that anything the oxymoronic tag <code>contemporary-history</code> can be applied to (currently 8 questions) is off-topic.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best thing we could do is come up with a special tag for such questions, so people who don't like them can avoid them (or see if it can be improved into a <em>real</em> history question). Unless someone says otherwise, I think I'll start tagging all such things <code>contemporary-history</code>. Since its sort of an oxymoron anyway, so that ought to be a nice flag for those in-the-know.</p>

<p>I'll throw up a counter-example: <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/1638/what-happens-after-a-widespread-social-chaos"">What happens after a widespread social chaos</a>. By most measures this would probably end up being an off-topic question. It's about present day events. It's very political. But the poor questioner is trying really hard to find himself some hope out of his present horrible situation by looking at history. If there is something we study history for (other than sheer fun) <em>this is it</em>. Most of the answers are IMHO (leaving mine aside) high quality attempts to enlighten. I really have a soft spot in my heart for this question, and would hate to see it have been uncerimoniously closed because it isn't Ivory Tower enough.</p>

<p>I don't really see how the question is suitable for site. First, the reasons for Che Guevara's fame (or infamy) are extremely well documented in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Che_Guevara"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> and the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/faq"">FAQ</a> clearly states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Questions answered by a simple Google search or to be found in a Wikipedia page</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While it might not always be obvious if a question is easily answered by a trivial search, I think it's painfully obvious that the question in question shows absolutely no prior effort, something that is generally required for questions on Stack Exchange sites.</p>
<p>Furthermore the question, as phrased, is not <em>really</em> asking for historical facts, but more seeking a discussion on the fame (or infamy) of Che Guevara. Even if it is on topic, it reads like an extremely not constructive question, and just for reference the not constructive close reason reads as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As it currently stands, this question is not a good fit for our Q&amp;A format. We expect answers to be supported by facts, references, or specific expertise, but this question will likely solicit debate, arguments, polling, or extended discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/4500/739"">The first answer</a> seems to prove that the question is <em>very</em> attractive to argumentative debate (and it's already generated a ton of off topic comments). It's horribly biased, and it reads more like something I would expect to read on the author's personal blog than on a high quality canonical resource on history. I'm not questioning the author's opinions and I don't necessarily disagree with him (her?), but I am questioning whether opinion heavy answers is what the site is for.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/4504/739"">other answer</a> is presented in a impartial way, but also doesn't really answer the question.</p>
<p>Nothing personal with either answerer, my peeve is with the question. I can completely understand how answerers couldn't resist the urge to answer such a question, but I really think that so poor questions can only lead to argumentative answers and are not the best advertisement for the site. The question is at +6, and other than featuring prominently on the front page it has been (automatically) <a href=""https://twitter.com/StackHistory/status/265222858328899584"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">twitted</a>, giving (imho) a wrong impression for the site.</p>
<p>In another question that seems to be suffering from the same issues, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/3100/why-is-king-henry-v-regarded-as-such-a-great-king"">Why is King Henry V regarded as such a great King?</a>, choster <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/3100/why-is-king-henry-v-regarded-as-such-a-great-king#comment7124_3100"">comments</a> (emphasis mine):</p>

<p>In the first case, if it is obvious that the question or answer doesn't follow our guidelines, I will usually leave a comment asking the person who created the post to modify it to make it fit.

<p>The rest of the question is ultimately what caused it to be closed, mostly because the other components are more likely to solicit opinion or discussion rather than provide a clear and objective answer. If the question gets modified then it could be reopened, especially if it focuses solely on what his achievements were.

We will usually leave a comment for the original poster to suggest that they modify the question, and if that is done then we can consider reopening.</p>

<p>The Meta area is the right place to be to have this type of discussion. However, as Michael already pointed out, the mods often wait to see how the community reacts to a question before deciding to close it. I agree that this one was a borderline question.

Let one of <em>them</em> get enough rep to do something about the supposed ""low quality"" item. That's part of the system too.</p>

<p>If the people with a problem with the question have a decent point, the first thing you should probably look to do is edit the question to make it better.</p>

(A bit more research shows the the questioner, while a useful contributor, is not a native English speaker, and does have an unfortunate habit of posing his questions and answers that way). So I just edited it. Perhaps that doesn't fix the problem, but if not I'm sure other users will say so.</p>

There is definitely no shortage of questions on this or any other SE site that could be considered sketchy, but we as moderators can't always act on every single one of them. We are volunteers who try to spend as much time as we can looking over the site and trying to keep it as current and relevant as possible.</p>

<p>Quite honestly, I personally do not ever read about 25% of the questions on this site when they are first submitted because I simply do not have the time. I eventually get around to reading all of them, but sometimes it may be a week or so after they are posted. I can't speak for other moderators, but I suspect they do not see most questions on the day they are submitted. (New answers are even harder to keep up with, but I won't go into that right now.)</p>

<p>Because of our limited time, we rely on the community to help bring our attention to potential problems. They do this by voting to close a question or by flagging it if they believe there is something that needs to be addressed. Pretty much every single day I look at every question that is flagged or voted on for closing or reopening. Questions or answers submitted by new users are automatically flagged, as are answers to older questions, so all of these get my attention first.</p>

<p>The short and simple answer is that this question got flagged and voted for closing, while most of the other questions did not. When we receive a flag, we have to make a decision based on a number of factors, and sometimes it comes down to just a personal evaluation. We are not always going to satsify everyone, but we certainly try.</p>

<p>Again, speaking for me personally, one of the first things I look at is the number of commenst vs. answers. This question has 9-0, which means it easily falls into the category of one that <em>will likely solicit debate, arguments, polling, or extended discussion</em>. Those are easy decisions for me when it comes to a request to close!</p>

<p>Another factor I consider is the number of votes (up or down) for either the question or any answers. Pretty much all of the examples you gave have good participation from the community, and as a moderator, we will very rarely do anything with one of those. At some point in the future as we get closer to becoming a full site, we will be required to clean up a lot of those or remove them, but until then the moderators are not going to act on them.</p>

<p>We don't claim to have the perfect solution. It is simply one in which we rely largely on the community to help give us guidance. All of these factors are weighed individually (and quite honestly, sometimes with some personal prejudice) before we decide how to act on them. As long as the community remains active and provides their feedback, we will be there trying to help mold this site into what you guys want it to be.</p>

<p>The idea of an ""Accepted"" answer that can <em>only</em> be awarded by the asker makes a lot of sense on Stack Overflow and other sites where people are trying to solve an immediate problem.  There are many technical reasons that a person might not be able to use the top-voted answer, so it's helpful to have a way of privileging a less popular answer that works for their specific situation.  It's a win-win because the asker can signal the answer that actually solved their problem and the community can signal the answer that is generally seen as ""best"".  (Often it's the same answer, which is convenient.)</p>

<p>But I've noticed that some sites don't work that way.  On a site like History.SE, the asker might be the <em>worst</em> person to pick a canonical answer.  Or at least, there's nothing special about the asker since they don't have any unique problems that need to be solved in an answer.  In a sense, the asker of a History question is not asking for themselves or their own circumstances, but for anyone who will use Google to search for answers.  When Joe Googler discovers that an answer has been accepted by History.SE (we can't expect him to know that accepted answers are chosen by the asker alone), he will naturally assume that the answer has been given some sort of stamp of approval.  That can be a mistaken assumption.</p>

<p>I've floated <a href=""https://christianity.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1402/914"">proposals</a> on <a href=""https://hermeneutics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/408/68"">other sites</a> that have the same profile.  My plan is to develop a consensus across a number of sites in order to propose something on Meta.StackExchange.com.  A <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/2014/why-did-civil-war-officers-tell-their-men-to-aim-low/5900#comment10372_5900"">comment</a> on an answer to one of my questions here, spurred me to bring this up here.  Obviously, I'm not really active here (yet?), but I get the sense that Accepted answers might be a stumbling block for users not intimately familiar with Stack Overflow.  Feel free to vote up or down this question to indicate whether or not you feel this change would help your community.  And also, feel free to answer with alternative proposals for consideration.</p>

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>Answers that have been ""Accepted"" by the asker are no longer pinned to the top of the answer queue.  All other effects of accepting an answer will remain the same on History.SE, but the accepted answer will be sorted just like any other answer.</p>

An upvote is <em>not</em> the traditional welcoming gift (it's usually a nice comment). If a post by a new user is good and worthy, by all means, upvote it. If it's a so-so post or even just wrong, don't go sympathy upvoting to 'welcome' the user. Help him/her out by leaving a constructive comment. Vote for the post, not the user. </p>

<p>Sympathy voting has two major problems: it encourages so-so to just wrong posts and it can remove all new user restrictions for that user.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When a new user writes a not-so-great post and it's upvoted out of sympathy (rather than because it was a great post), the new user now has a distorted view of what is a quality post and what needs work. Leave a constructive comment to help them a along, but don't upvote the post because it's a first post.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/privileges/new-user"">New user restrictions</a> are removed at 10 rep. Sympathy upvoting an answer removes all of these restrictions, but the user has not really earned them. New user restrictions are precautionary measures. Sympathy upvoting destroys the whole point of them. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So just keep in mind that the next time you see the first post of a new user, you're shaping their SE experience. Don't hesitate to leave a constructive comment. It goes a long way in helping the user get used to SE and how it works. However, don't go sympathy voting if the vote is undeserved. A constructive comment goes a long way farther than a careless upvote.</p>

<p>Don't be to concerned about the stats. The SE team takes more into account than that when considering a site for graduation. Hitting the right numbers there is not necessarily a 'switch' to exiting beta. We need high quality answers and experts. This idea can help with that, but it can be approached with the wrong mindset.

<p>I'm wondering if this has ever come up before on a SE site. Its a very interesting issue that I'd never had to think about before. I had to think fairly hard about it. Here is why, in the end, I put the PBUH back.</p>

<p>The issue here is how to handle <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_be_upon_him_%28Islam%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ṣalawāt</a>, which many devout Muslims are compelled by their religion to follow any reference to a revered Prophet or archangel.</p>

<p>We do differ from Wikipedia in one rather important respect. Our question and answer format gives each question and each answer a specific author. Unlike Wikipedia, we prominently (and permanently) display this author for as long as that question or answer exists.</p>

<p>As such, if a question or answer author on an SE site feels compelled to add a ṣalawāt, I believe it would be wrong for an editor remove it. It is their question, and we should not be rephrasing it in a way that would seem like disrespectful phrasing to them or their community, and then <em>leave their name prominently attached to it</em>. </p>

<p>Likewise, I believe it would also be wrong for a devout Muslim with edit privs to go through here and start <em>adding</em> PBUH to the entries of those who didn't want it.</p>

<p>The exception would be community wiki entries (which have the author's name removed). In that case, I think the Wikipedia policy is a good one.</p>

<p>""Our Lord Jesus"", IMHO would be a bit different. Nobody really looks askance at a Christian who just says ""Jesus"", and the phrase makes an assertion of divinity, which in my mind would be a huge red flag that the question belongs on Christianity.SE. Merely wishing a deceased person peace (PBOH) is something I (as a Christian) have no religious issue with whatsoever. </p>

For example: <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/7318/which-is-the-first-genocide/7319#7319"">Which is the first genocide?</a></p>

<p>Also, many questions about the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bronze-age"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;bronze-age&#39;"" rel=""tag"">bronze-age</a> cannot be properly answered without using a mix of both History and Archeology (and sometimes Linguistics).</p>

<p>So personally, I'd also be OK with it never making, and us keeping <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bronze-age"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;bronze-age&#39;"" rel=""tag"">bronze-age</a>, and <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pre-history"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;pre-history&#39;"" rel=""tag"">pre-history</a> to ourselves.</p>

<p>I will say that IMHO the question is still low quality. It isn't the subject matter, so much as it is the fact that its very painful to read. Even the title has really bad grammar (the first phrase has no verb, and the second depends on implicit information from that same first. Parsing that thing takes twice as long as it should). It goes on in that same demi-grammatical vein for several screens. The quote you posted is overly large, and contains unprintable characters, which again make it a pain to read. The link you added was just a raw link (going on for 6 lines on my screen!) rather than a nice bit of text hyperlinked. The posting tools make the latter easy to accomplish, so its tough to understand why you didn't do that simple thing for your readers. If it was a short two-paragraph question, I'd be tempted to edit it myself, but its sheer length makes the task daunting.</p>

<p>I don't normally like to be critical at length on other's writing. My own spelling is notoriously bad (an editor here once compared it to a war crime), so I know I'm throwing stones in a glass house here. But you did ask, and that's what I'm seeing.</p>

<p>Now as I said, I wasn't a downvoter. For all I know they had other reasons. But my suggestion would be to clean up the grammar and the other things I mentioned, make the whole thing easier on the eyes, and perhaps some folks will be able to look at it long enough to see the merit in it.</p>

Well, im hoping to get some really professional help with my re-enactment. While im trying to educate myself on history, in order to re-enact the proper way only with my own research, Id have to make several degrees in history and read through a few libraries. Just starting off with some questions off the top of my mind, since I started only recently</p>

<p><strong>Why should it exist?</strong>
Why, to have and expert source of <strong>up to date</strong> knowledge about history. I cant possibly follow every archeological journal, specialist, publication, university, etc etc. We need a source of reliable, scientific, high quality knowledge. The truth is, popular books on history are simply swarimng with errors on almost every aspect. Some of the illustrations of medieval armour are more fantasy than history in books that are supposed to be educational! We need a place where we can ask for info and we will get facts, backed up with finding, iconography, documents from the period and expert analysis of them.</p>

<p><strong>What purpose does it serve and how does it make the Internet better?</strong>
The internet is cluttered and even more erronous that the books. Most people write about how they imagine history (especially medieval and how its viewed by the prism of knight romances) rather than how it actually was. Also, everything mentioned in previous posts.</p>

<p><strong>Do we need to re-scope this site to appeal to the more academic nature of historians and historical study?</strong> 
Well, maybe a bit. I looked through some of the questions on the site and I dont feel they are answerable in an expert manner. If someone asks about causality of some events, how one thing or person affected another etc. The answer will be either speculative, or would need an entire scientific article or book to write it down. Many questions are really difficult to answer, meaning - it would take an enormous effort to give a reasonable answer. Examples? <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/2312/how-did-medieval-armies-survive-the-use-of-mail-armor-in-the-deserts-of-the-midd"">How did Medieval Armies survive the use of mail armor in the deserts of the Middle East?</a>. The top rated answer took the right course - the scientific way would be to do experimental archeology. In Poland we actually have a group who does such things. They equip them selves nearly 100% historically (they even use hand-woven materials for their clothes) and travel by foot and by horse, eat historically prepped foot on such journes etc etc. They have gained a LOT of high quality knowlege about travelling in the middle ages. Right now theyre getting ready for a 400km journey on foot in the south of the country. Perhaps they could accurately answer the qeustion I linked, if they were to go Middle East ;) Im quite sure they could provide some great community-wiki questions and answers and Id love to see such people here. Im making some questions from the begginer/advanced reenactors point of view, but I feel my questions are of a totally different sort than most of the site. Maybe more such qeustions would interest real pro's? Theyre the sort of question you cant really answer simply flipping through Wikipedia and a book entidled ""Knights through history"".</p>

<p>It seems like you are asking how to ask subjective questions on this site. You might want to read this blog post from the Stack Exchange blog on ""<a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/"">Good Subjective, Bad Subjective.</a>"" The post refers to the following six guidelines for drafting subjective questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Great subjective questions inspire answers that explain “why” and “how”.</li>
  <li>Great subjective questions tend to have long, not short, answers.</li>
  <li>Great subjective questions have a constructive, fair, and impartial tone. </li>
  <li>Great subjective questions invite sharing experiences over opinions.</li>
  <li>Great subjective questions insist that opinion be backed up with facts and references.</li>
  <li>Great subjective questions are more than just mindless social fun.</li>
  </ol>

<p>If you are asking questions about what was <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/7839/who-really-put-to-flight-american-hostages-in-americas-embassy-in-tehran-in-197"">more important between a set of things</a> that isn't a good fit for the site. This site tries to focus on questions that can be answered objectively by referencing historical facts. Sometimes you may notice that questions ask ""what were the factors that contributed to this event,"" that may seem like a subjective question, because it is in part. However, that question differs from asking what is important, because it invites the person who answers to answer with factors, but not to make judgment calls amongst those factors.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that history and politics are frequently intertwined, it's hard to answer in general without seeing a specific question.</p>

<p>The rule of thumb would be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you need historical knowledge to answer a historical/political question (e.g. access to documents from Churchill administration, even if the question is about Churchill's politics) it may be best to ask on History. </p>

<p>It would <strong>ALSO be ontopic</strong> on Politics, but there's a better chance of a good answer here - more people here are likely to know how/where to access Churchill's archives than on Politics.</p></li>
<li><p>If the question is pure politics <strong>without the need for historical expertise/knowledge</strong> (e.g. what are details of this current law), then it <strong>is OFFtopic</strong> for History and should be asked on Politics.</p></li>
<li><p>If the question is dealing with politics but touches on history, it's <strong>NOT offtopic</strong> on either site. But again, one of the sites might be a better fit for any given specific question, depending on its exact historical quotient; even if it is on-topic on both.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Short version - you will be most at risk at being considered offtopic on History.SE if the question is purely political, and no historian or history enthusiast would possibly be interested in it from historical perspective.</p>

<hr>

<p>Having said that, please realize that there's a difference between ""offtopic for this site"" - but ontopic for Politics - and ""subjective question that does not belong on any SE site, because it can not be answered objectively, just discussed"".

<p>There's sort of a meta-(meta?)-answer here, in that we probably don't have that particular tag because there haven't been a lot of specifically New Deal questions asked, which would be needed to make such a tag useful. I did a quick search and could only find one, and that was a troll question that was quite rightly closed.</p>

<p>So let's go a level deeper: Why haven't there been a lot of New Deal questions? Well, they simply haven't been asked yet. History is a big subject of which US history is a small part, and the New Deal is a small part of that small part. Unless we happen to get some users who have an interest, and questions, on that particular small part of history, we won't have questions. If we don't have the questions, we won't have the tags.</p>

<p>So basically I can tell you as a relatively new user, if you think there should be more New Deal questions here, then feel free to ask them.

<p>After spending some time sitting back and taking a break from this site, to me part of the problem with adding experts here is being able to get people who can adapt to the culture of SE.  My involvement with another research-based site shows me that there are two definite shifts in how questions/answers are presented in academic sites and places like SE where the community is more involved in how reputation and answers are perceived.  Experts in some areas, and I can luckily say some of my history professors were not like this, can be prickly when their research and authority in subjects is attacked, which will happen in SE.  I've seen it happen in many questions on SE History as a mod, though it's a small portion of what I've seen it may be a stumbling block with others getting involved.  Especially considering the ""burn"" others may have had in previous exposures to SE sites and involvement in public forums like this.</p>

<p>Remember these are people who spend their time as experts in subjects and some do not take direct challenges well to their knowledge of subjects.  While getting younger members of the community may help, as they are more familiar with the social media aspects of online communities and may have thicker skins for criticism that may arise.  Introducing them to SE History may be good, but the introduction has to draw them in, and I am not sure even the current state of SE History questions is enough to bring them in.  I know this goes back to the question quality problem we struggled with early on, and I can see it somewhat still happens, but then this is for people to have questions who may or may not be History professionals or academics, it's a place for answers.  Consider as well, that while we have stressed in the past that answers should have some documentation for them, not all do.  Many are someone's recollection or knowledge put out there, and some have sources to back up the statements, and many sources are not Wikipedia.  What would be the expectation of an academic who is more used to using sources to back up their thesis or paper?  This sort of loops back to the reputation aspect, here is someone who is already known in another community as knowledgable in their field but here they are starting over, many would not want to do that.</p>

<p>As far as the wording ""people"", I suspect someone just copy/pasted a Wikipedia or dictionary article. Grammatically it's incorrect to add ""and people"" when using the term ""Persia"", you are correct.</p>

<p><strong>However, I would argue that the wording is perfectly fine and should stay.</strong></p>

<p>Remember that the tag Wiki is not exactly there to only define a term, but to define which questions should be tagged with the tag.</p>

<li><p>""Middle East"" is a concept that changed as a term a LOT over the years, which is why it's best not to use it. It's more of a layman political term than a geographical term anyway. <strong>""Southwest Asia"" is a correct geographical location for it so that should stay</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>""Sassanid+"": Achaemenid empire is known as ""First Persian Empire"" (and was called Parsā), therefore <strong>you are definitely correct that this should be changed to ""From the ancient  Achaemenid Empire"" instead</strong>.</p>

<p>The answer was the most upvoted.</p>

<p>The content of the answer is as follows:</p>

<p>===</p>

<p>Of course it was not a human rights document. At best it is a code of laws, which can be seen as a summary of civil rights.</p>

<p>Civil rights should not be confused with human rights as human rights are construed to belong to all people, including slaves, foreigners and defeated enemy.</p>

<p>This is the <a href=""http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/articles/c/cyrus_cylinder_-_translation.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">full text of the Cyrus cylinder</a>. Contrary to my previous speculation, it is not a code of laws. The text does not do anything with the rights of anybody.</p>

<p>The first part of the document is in the third person.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first part denigrates the previous kings of Babylon, especially their religious practices, halting the offerings and the like.</p></li>
<li><p>The Gods disliking this previous king decided to choose a better one, whom they decided should be Cyrus.</p></li>
<li><p>Then follows the part where it is described how much the people and subordinated kings love Cyrus and kiss his feet.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The second part is explained from the name of Cyrus himself:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The full title of Cyrus </p></li>
<li><p>Cyrus describes that his troops entered Babylon peacefully (following the city's surrender) and made no damage to the population and temples.</p></li>
<li><p>Again how much the subordinated kings and representatives of remote quarters expressed love and loyalty to him and kissed his feet.</p></li>
<li><p>He then describes how he restored and rebuilt the temples.</p></li>
<li><p>He then describes how he improved the defenses and city walls.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The claim that it has something about ""human rights"" is described as a hoax, for example, <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/falling-for-ancient-propaganda-un-treasure-honors-persian-despot-a-566027-2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">by Spiegel</a>.</p>

<p>Any question that asks us to take a critical examination of the religous beliefs of a rather large amount of humanity (including SE participants), is a rhetorical minefield. Answers have to be really really careful, or the entire question will devolve into unhelpful arguing. Sadly, I don't think the original text of my answer was anywhere near up to that standard, so that's precisely what happened. (My bad there. I've since improved it I think, but its probably far too late now).</p>

<p>I'd like to see an answer here from an actual closer, but I think I can make a rough guess that this was about worries of both questions emitting more heat than light.</p>

<p>Ideally we should be able to dispassionately examine questions like this and come up with good answers. However, as long as we have to rely on messy humans to do the job for us, there are going to be problems around emotional topics.</p>

Some folks don't like to have their accept percentange on their information page drop. I've seen cases on other stacks where a low accept percentage has been used against a poster, so its somewhat understandable. For this reason, I think a lot of people will accept an answer even if they don't believe it answers their question. (Although a quick check of my percentange will show you I'm <em>not</em> one of those people) So on a one-answer question like this, IMHO an acceptance doesn't nessecarily mean much.</p>

<p>That being said, I generally have no problem with answers that don't quite answer the question as posed. Sometimes there's an underlying issue that needs to be addressed. Some times the question itself is somehow wrong (bad assumptions typically). Some times the question isn't really answerable with the knowledge available to us today (possibly the situation here). However, a ""redirection"" answer should probably make it clear that is what you are doing.</p>

<p>As someone who has made rather a lot of ""not quite answer"" answers, downvotes on that technicality are just part of the price of doing business. Hopefully its valuable enough that you get more up than down.</p>

<p>There is a fine line there though. If you're just making a short point on that same topic, really you ought to be writing a comment.</p>

However, it seems to me that the historicity of the Qur'an and the New Testament when it pertains to the life of Jesus have opposite problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Qur'an is clearly <em>not</em> a useful source of historical information on Jesus because it's at best <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_source"" rel=""nofollow"">third-hand information</a>, written hundreds of years after the events, with clear biases that provides no truly independent information.  So the question really can only be answered in the negative.  It's not going to be constructive to ask, since any answer will likely be uninteresting to historians or attract controversy.</p></li>
<li><p>The New Testament are secondary sources (with respect to Jesus), written within 100 years or so of the events, that provide independent information.  However, they have clear biases.  Writing a comprehensive answer would require a book (or even several) to pull apart all the issues.  On top of that, the specific question was poorly researched and cited one (very biased) website.  It just doesn't come across as an honest question.  (And if you have followed the OP at all, you have a sense of <em>deja vu</em> on that point.)</p></li>

Most them were closed or downvoted by the others! As I am just about one month in SE and some users in those forums tried to close or delete all my questions one after one without any convincing comment or respond, I thought with myself how can it be a fairly judgment which they can suspend me because of using my right for downvote a user (only by this pretext that ""the systems' algorithms shows it as a irregular voting"") who has made more than 10 questions in one day but if s/he tries the same against all my questions and answers as I am a new user and have only 5 or 6 questions or answers, surely the system doesn't show anything wrong, there is no punishment for him/her? This special user has high scores and very easily closes my right questions with high votes and good answers and even s/he follows me in different forums and downvotes me or sends offending comments for me after making any question in the other forums. I asked it if there is a solution to defend of my rights as I find it a kind of discrimination against myself and a misusing of systematic rules against new users. This problem gives a chance to high score users to impose their ideas to a majority who are new users and easily it can change SE forums to mafia managing systems not a fairly system which can recognize what positive cooperation means.</p>

I have gone through and deleted all of your comments on this question for that very reason. When you start using words that may be construed as a verbal attack on others or may be interpreted as inflamatory, then you are not doing much to make yourself appear to be a sincere and committed participant of this site. I can guarantee that if you have more downvotes than upvotes, or even more than 10% of your total votes are downvotes, you are very likely to have your account suspended.</p>

<p>The use of a vote is NOT a weapon or tool that you can use to ""get even"" with someone. It should ONLY be used to reflect how well you think the question was answered or how well you think a question was asked. Although it is not a required policy to do so, I believe that a user should always strongly consider giving a justification for any downvote via a comment, and that apllies to everyone.</p>

<p>Personally, I have felt that your behavior in this forum has been extremely confrontational and I am very sorely tempted to suspend your account right now. I am in the process of moving and have very limited time online, so I can't go through and look at all of your activity at the moment. However, once I do have more time I intend to research your activity very closely, and if I feel that your behavior merits it, I will follow suit with all of the other forums you have indicated and suspend your account.</p>

<p>There is one relatively new user, who I feel is POTENTIALLY valuable to the site, because of her Persian/Iranian background, the unique perspective it affords her, and some questions from her that seem to be good at their core. I took the liberty of editing one question about the ""confusion"" between the Persian and Arabian Gulf. (Unfortunately, she edited my editing, including restoring a reference to a ""big lie"" that I had taken out.)

At some level, she now appears to realize this, yt asking ""how many times can I vote without being suspended?"" A moderator seemed to answer that suspension was a very real possbility. If she were, the site would lose someone with a potentially valuable background, IMHO.</p>

<p>Is there anything we can do to ""rehabilitate"" this individual, short of suspension? For instance, her level of downvoting is a matter of concern, but it wouldn't be an issue if her reputation were as low as 124 (it's ""dangerously"" close to that level now).

While it makes obvious sense to replace tags with more specific ones as they become available, it doesn't serve anyone to have a thousand tags with one entry in them, either.</p>

<p>One of the problems with a site simply called ""history"" is that there are many approaches to history. Some have an interest in a time period, others in a particular civilization or cultural group, others in an aspect of human society across time periods and civilizations, others in a particular school of analysis applicable to all of the above.  As the site is still in its relative infancy, we lack a complete set of tags for all those angles, (we don't even have <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/angles"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;angles&#39;"" rel=""tag"">angles</a>). Moreover, we are also limited to five tags per question, and there is no way to set up hierarchical relationships between tags.</p>

<p>At the same time, a thousand tags with a single question in each doesn't make it easy to follow questions about the same topic. You subscribed to <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/military"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;military&#39;"" rel=""tag"">military</a> but didn't see my question? Well, silly, you should have subscribed to <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/air-force"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;air-force&#39;"" rel=""tag"">air-force</a> instead. No, wait, to <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/aerial-bombardment"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;aerial-bombardment&#39;"" rel=""tag"">aerial-bombardment</a>. Sorry, I meant <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/strategic-bombing"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;strategic-bombing&#39;"" rel=""tag"">strategic-bombing</a>. Well, I wouldn't have tagged it as <em>military</em>, since it's not a question about the entire military, right?.</p>

<p>So, tags like <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/europe"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;europe&#39;"" rel=""tag"">europe</a> are not just for questions encompassing all of Europe, but for questions about topics within Europe that do not [yet] have a more specific tag, so that enthusiasts and experts in European history can have a go at them. Have a question about Henri IV? Great, tag it with <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/france"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;france&#39;"" rel=""tag"">france</a>. But a question about the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth? For now, I'd say tag it as <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/europe"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;europe&#39;"" rel=""tag"">europe</a>, until we have a half-dozen questions just about the Commonwealth and can justify spitting it out as a specialty.</p>

<p>You shouldn't be looking to downvote questions of one user, this is just plain wrong and I imagine the reason you were suspended. Please do not target specific users with your votes (up or down), instead vote for posts. You shouldn't care at all who the author of the post is, the only thing you should care about is how helpful and well researched the post is.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the mechanics of the serial voting script are intentionally kept vague to prevent people from gaming the system. If you knew that you could downvote another user's posts <code>x</code> times per day and get away with it, then what's stopping you from downvoting <code>x</code> posts every day for ever?</p>

<p>What I can tell you is that the rules are the same for everyone, on every Stack Exchange site. It doesn't depend on whom you are downvoting or on the mods' imagination, there is an automated process that detects serial voting, and it runs the same checks on everyone's account. </p>

We have suggested that you read the FAQ so that you would have a better understanding of what is appropriate and what reasons would justify the downvoting of a question or an answer.</p>

<p>Having said that, if we see that you are going through every question or answer that was posted by one individual, or by a small group of individuals, then we see that as an attack on that individual. You don't downvote posts because of the individual, you downvote them because of the content. </p>

<p>A very clear indication is an answer that has received 16 consecutive upvotes, and then suddenly receives one downvote. Then we observe that several other answers by the same individual, all with more than ten upvotes and no downvotes, start to receive single downvotes, and they are all from the same individual. I give this specific example because this actually happened (but I'm not saying it was you who did it).</p>

<p>Quite frankly, unless you are going through every Q&amp;A on the site and downvoting only the ones that have already received multiple downvotes, you are going to be flagged. It doesn't matter if you use one or one hundred, if they are not justified, then you will be suspeneded again, and this time for a longer period.</p>

If you ask ""Why write another History book"", it invites a list of reason, many or most of which would be subjective in nature. If you ask ""What elements go into writing a History book"", you might still receive a list, but it will be more finite, AND it can be answered with concrete, objective information. ""How would you write another History book"" would most likely be viewed in a similar light as the first example, because everybody would have a different opinion, and we are not looking for opinions, but rather facts.</p>

<p>When I review a question, I always think first of the W principles: Who, What, Why, Where, When, and How (which ends in W). ;) Of these, Why and How tend to be the most problematic questions, because they tend to solicit opinions or discussion (debates). It is very important to consider the way a question is worded to ensure that it doesn't fall into that category.</p>

<p>None of them. It's not about <em>who</em> you vote for, it's about <em>how</em> you vote.</p>

<p>You can find the canonical answer to this question <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/12/vote-fraud-and-you/"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of today, we have several queries that look for unusual downvote patterns. If we discover these patterns in a given user’s voting history, we view all their downvotes for that user as suspect. They’re all silently deleted, and any lost reputation is restored to the unfortunate target of these downvotes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, it's the wrong question to be asking; if you need to know this, <em>you're doing it wrong.</em> Vote on the <em>content</em>, not the <em>person</em>. If you find yourself going through someone's profile down-voting everything they've written, stop and ask yourself:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is this person blatantly abusing the site by posting nothing but low-quality content? If so, <strong>flag one of their posts for moderator attention</strong> and explain the situation; they may need a talking-to.</p></li>
<li><p>Have I become overly fixated on the personality of the person involved? Did they annoy me in some fashion, to where I'm now being exceptionally critical of their work vs. the work of others on the site? If so, <strong>stop, walk <em>away</em> from your computer, and calm down.</strong> You're not being objective, and this is likely skewing your voting.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that moderators can't see individual votes - only patterns. If a moderator is chiding you for abusive voting, chances are the system has detected something unusual in how you're casting your votes; if you do not heed their advice and adjust your behavior, you'll probably find your votes invalidated and possibly even your account suspended. </p>

<p>The problem with using <code>african-americans</code> is that implies to me a people, rather than a culture.

<p>For that reason, I'm actually in this case happier with <code>african-american</code> (an adjective, not a noun).</p>

<p>Formerly a lot of african-american cultural items were referred to as ""negro"", and many things from that era kept the name (eg: Negro league baseball, Negro Spirituals).

<ul>
<li>Absent a citation, it is impossible to give an answer; it is only
possible to discuss.  If there is a citation (e.g. ""'The Protocols of
the Elders of Zion' advances the claim of blood libel."") then we can
apply scholarship to discuss the credibility, bias and other issues
that might cause that source to make that claim.  [Please note, I'm
using that source not to give offence, but as an example of a place
where the source of the claim is very important to the answer].</li>
<li>Uncited suspicions are invitations to discussion:  Fundamentally the question devolves to ""People say X, I think Y, what do you think?""</li>
<li>Uncited sources mean that the querent hasn't met the minimum standard recommended by the FAQ - this is not a place to ask questions that could be answered by a simple google search.</li>
<li>In general responsible answers to questions without sources require a book length response.  </li>
</ul>

<p>I've downvoted a number of questions that I think fit this pattern, but I'm frustrated. I want the new people, I want them to feel welcome, but I honestly believe that these questions diminish the value of H:SE.  They sufficiently fuel my inner curmudgeon that I'm falling below the standard of courtesy I expect from myself in this forum.   If I am out of line, I welcome correction.  If however others notice this trend I invite anyone who can suggest a way that we can discourage these questions without discouraging the querent.  I'm going to continue downvoting them, but I shall refrain from commenting.</p>

some definition of capitalism in some forum somewhere at some time.</li>

<p><strong>The problem isn't with ""harebrained un-cited idea"" being used</strong>, as TED's answer put it. The problem is with that idea <strong>being formulated as unanswerable (usually, confusing or subjective) question</strong>. </p>

<p>In other words, it's <strong>correlation, NOT causation</strong>. Yes, many of the un-cited weird ideas arise in otherwise bad questions (possibly due to the kinds of users who would subscribe to random conspiracy theories?). But they don't cause the questions to be bad.</p>

<p>Let's look at your examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In all fairness, ""Sea Peoples"" question is good on the simple and practical ground that it resulted in good answers :) </p></li>
<li><p>Khazakh and anticapitalism is as much ""common wisdom"" as ""Great Game"" among people familiar with the culture. Whatever other faults of that question, if you yourself accept that ""common wisdom"" needs not be cited, this one fits.</p></li>
<li><p>I agree that #3 is a bad question, though it has problems galore aside from the one you stated. You can't figure out what's being asked. Nevertheless, it CAN be turned into a good question if someone cared enough, based on that same uncited idea, IMHO.</p></li>
<li><p>Reasons for the Renaissance - ditto as #1. Resulted in great answers, totally irrelevant as to what the (cited or nor) theory in the question stated.</p></li>
<li><p>Great Game - you yourself admitted it doesn't really fit ""uncited"" mold due to being common wisdom.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>You seem to be confusing two different kinds of questions (and yes, may be because OPs confused them as well):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Here's a historical theory (cited). Can it be proven/disproved, especially based on research done by the source I cited?</p>

<p>This one is MUCH better if cited, as then the cites can be checked and peer reviewed.</p></li>
<li><p>Here's some random information blob ""X"" (which could be a cited theory, or un-cited theory, or anything else) pertaining to historical area of study ""Y"". Can more information <strong>of a specific nature</strong> be shed on area of study ""Y"" as it relates to ""X""?</p>

<p>This one can be good or bad, depending on how focused the SECOND part of the question is. But again, there's nothing precluding the second part to be a good question (e.g. <em>Sea Peoples</em> as example) no matter what the excuse/basis for arriving at that question was. </p>

<p>A good indicator of this is that the second part would work as a question if you completely re-worded the first part as a clarifying part of the question instead of being a theory cited as reason for asking.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>In summary:</strong> Downvote/VTC questions <strong>because they are innately bad</strong> (e.g. can not be authoritatively and objectively answered aside from random opinions); don't pay much attention to whether the inspiration or the source of the question is a cited theory or not.</p>

<p>There are definitely some (strong) signs that the question should be on topic: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>It's clearly interesting to historians and history buffs</strong></p>

<p>The upvotes on the question and on your answer, and the lack of close votes are proof of that.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It was answered, correctly and fast</strong> </p>

<p>Correctly obviously being the important part, fast the ""nice to have"" part.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But, there are also problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>It's a non searchable question</strong></p>

<p>The title is awfully generic, and I don't think there's much room for improvement. The question text is... what question text? All we really have to go on in terms of searchability and categorization is the tags. And those are awfully generic as well.</p>

<p>This is an important issue, as this type of question is practically undiscoverable through search engines, and thus not particularly useful in terms of helping the site grow. That of course is no reason to outright ban the category, but it certainly reason enough for me to not be particularly enthusiastic about further encouraging similar questions. </p>

<p>A related issue is that the type is also not particularly accessible, as is typical with media heavy content. While I realize that might not be a very important factor for most, it is for me. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>It's sort of a guessing game question</strong></p>

<p>Almost every Stack Exchange site has it's own <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/02/lets-play-the-guessing-game/"">""guessing game"" questions</a>, and they've proven to be more trouble than they are worth. This type of question shares a lot of characteristics with ""guessing game"" questions, although I don't think it fits the description 100%. </p>

<p>We are of course free to decide on our own what kind of questions we welcome on the site (within certain broad limits) and I'm not saying that we should outright ban the category just because similar categories didn't work elsewhere. But, it wouldn't hurt to take notice of the experience of others and not repeat the same mistake.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The low end of the quality spectrum is going to be awful</strong> </p>

<p>Ok, this is more speculation than fact. But I'm afraid that while the question in question is good, the low end of the category is going to be truly awful. Stuff like either extremely well known pictures (that will bore most of us very quickly) or extremely low quality pictures, from weird angles, etc.</p>

<p>And, just to push my paranoia up to eleven, the category offers a lot of opportunities for trolling. I have quite a few pictures that <em>look like</em> they are somehow historically significant but aren't really (just old), and I can troll the site's crowd right now by having you all going around and trying to answer unanswerable questions.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'll stop here, because this seems to be turning out a lot more gloomy than I originally intended. My take is that I don't see any reason to outright ban the category of questions but at the same time I don't see any reason to encourage them as well. If they continue appearing, so be it, and we'll deal with any problems as (if?) they appear. If not, meh. </p>

IMHO, staff members of the Stack Exchange (SE) should have ""full"" moderator privileges to close and delete questions and answers, and suspend members, etc. This is so that they can protect us all from what I call the three P's (profanity, pornography, and plagiarism), and similar problems (the fourth p). That's their ""day job"" and the fact that their jobs, reputations and livelihoods are on the line gives them the requisite ""skin in the game"" to do this effectively. The following comments are meant to relate to ""non=paid"" moderators drawn from the community.</p>

<p>Right now, a moderator can unilaterally close a question, which can also be done with FIVE votes from qualified members of the community. Meaning that a moderator in effect has five close (or reopen) votes.</p>

<p>A ""three vote"" moderater would have three, not five votes to close or open a question, which is to say no such unilateral power. Instead, it would take TWO moderators (six votes) to close or reopen a question, or a moderator and two senior community members. It often happens that questions are closed this latter way; two or three community members vote to close, and a moderator comes along and ""finishes"" the job without the need for five votes.</p>

<p>This could come about in two ways. We could either limit all moderators to three votes, or have two classes of moderators: One or two people with five close votes, and the others with three.</p>

<p>I was offered a chance by Anna Lear to be a pro temp moderator for the site. I respectfully declined, partly because of day job pressures, and partly because I was uncomfortable with a moderator's unilateral closing powers. One reason I declined was that if I had full moderator privileges (and resp;onsibilities), it would have felt too much like a ""day job,"" (and perhaps detracted from my real one.) If I had been given a chance to be a ""three vote"" moderator, I might have accepted it, since I could contribute to the site with extra votes that reflect my high reputation, but without having to ""sweat out"" whether I was doing the right thing by unilaterally closing something.</p>

<p>(I've been spending a lot of time on the site recently, in spite of myself. One way I justify this is by the fact that a number of what purport to be history questions are really ""day job"" questions in disguise. For instance, this question about troops with different backgrounds <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/8054/at-the-battle-of-zama-was-the-roman-army-more-native-than-the-carthaginian/8268#8268"">At the Battle of Zama, was the Roman army more &quot;native&quot; than the Carthaginian?</a> could really be a question about the relative strengths of moderators drawn from SE vs. the Community.)</p>

<p>What do others think about having a group of moderators from the community with ""limited"" powers? That is three votes instead of five on close/open questions, and perhaps the power to ""supend"" accounts for brief periods (to send a message to SE moderators) but not to delete them.</p>

<li>Account suspensions (can't be reviewed and of course can't be reversed by the community)</li>
<li>Account deletions and destructions (same as deletion, but it also deletes all of the account's posts)</li>

<li>Comment deletions (yes, even those are more powerful as they are not reversible)</li>

<p>Closures are pretty tame in comparison, they are public, relatively harmless and quite easily reversible. I have absolutely no idea why we should sacrifice moderator efficiency or why you think you'd have to ""sweat out"" for something that so easy to fix if you happen to get it wrong.</p>

<p>As a moderator, if you are uncertain of whether a question belongs on the site or not, you simply do <em>not</em> vote to close it.

<li><p>I don't think such an approach is <strong>required</strong> for practical reasons on History.SE with the current moderators.</p>

<li><p>However, I very strongly feel that strongly limiting the ability of moderators to cast binding close votes is a great idea <strong>as a concept</strong> for all SE sites.</p>

<p>On another SE site I have had a case where 3 of my questions closed unilaterally by the same mod in 1-2 day period. <strong>2 of them were reopened after I raised the issue and explained why the mod was wrong on Meta</strong> - the mod was wrong in both binding votes. I could probably have gotten #3 reopened as well but was too exhausted to bother. </p>

<p>On a technical level, an ideal solution IMHO would be to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Limit binding closures to very special cases (e.g. closing as SPAM or offensive), where doing the closing <strong>quickly</strong> is of essence. On newer lower volume site, waiting for 2-3 high-rep users to get to the bad question can take a while.</p></li>
<li><p>In all other cases, force the 3-vote-binding-closing limit as discussed by Tom's question.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow an easy reversal of binding authoritarian vote (e.g. one where there weren't 2 other high-rep users voting to close as well) via VTRO. In other words, even one (or may be two?) VTRO votes by people other than OP on a question unilaterally closed by a mod is enough to erase the mod's close vote. </p>

<p>To me, this seems like a factual statement and nothing more. I do find it annoying that none of the answerers (including yourself) bothered to reference any sources, but labeling that quote as offensive or insensitive is more than a stretch (imho).</p>

<p>Furthermore, referring to Hitler as a ""jailbird"", ""excruciating"" and a ""derelict"" is unnecessary emotive, and frankly a bit annoying. ""convicted felon"", on the other hand, I don't have a problem with, it's factually correct. We are here to study history, our answers should be as academic as they can be. We are answering questions, we are not writing blog posts. </p>

<p>To be perfectly honest, I find it a bit hypocritical that you are annoyed by someone's factual statements, that are phrased in a mostly neutral way, when you have employed copious amounts of emotive language in the past. Yes, Hitler was as close to true evil as it gets, but the facts are more than enough to convey that message, no need for the rhetoric.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that <em>distances</em> you from anything; both of those terms are judgmental - you're not referring to him as a prisoner or convict; ""jailbird"" carries with it the connotation of ""habitual offender"", while ""poor, badly educated derelict"" certainly goes beyond just describing him as a man of limited means. Without context, I would assume you were trying to trash the guy...</p>

<p>...But if I were inclined to read your answer with a jaundiced eye, I might assume you were trying to caste him in the roll of a Horatio Alger rags-to-riches hero! I doubt that was your intention, but such is the danger of trying to interpret intentions when reading, as well as the value of ""neutral"" language when describing actions and events. </p>

<p>I don't think the author of the answer you linked intended his choice of words as a <em>defense</em> of Hitler's actions or motivations; rather, he's attempting to place them in the context where they occurred. Hard to read? Yes! These are not pretty things. Insensitive? In the context of the question, no. </p>

<p>Consider <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/8409/can-we-classify-holocaust-as-hitlers-war-time-strategic-mistake/8414#8414"">your own answer</a>, which focuses more on the invasion of the USSR: this also involved casualties in the millions, and unimaginable brutality. Are you being ""insensitive"" by treating this as a strategic decision? No; again, this was the entire purpose of the question.</p>

<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/8714/what-was-the-nature-of-resistance-in-1938-czechoslovakia"">What was the Nature of Resistance in 1938 Czechoslovakia?</a></p>

<p>The more I think about it, the more I think it should be closed. I had earlier voted to close as ""too localized."" If I were to do it today, the reason would be ""not a real question."" I am asking this meta question both about the original question itself, and about future questions that may use a similar (and presumably flawed) format. I actually like the content per se.</p>

<p>I am not against using the site to research historical novels; I've written one or two (unpublished) ones myself. But I am critiquing the question from the point of view of a fellow amateur novelist.</p>

<p>A good question should be fairly narrow. A hypothetical question in my view might be something like this: ""Some of my older friends or inlaws know someone who escaped from Sobibor (a death camp) in World War II. My novel is about what happened to such an escapee afterward. But how did s/he escape in the first place?"" <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_from_Sobibor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_from_Sobibor</a></p>

<p>Ideally, the question would contain this link and ask for relevant details of the escape that the link doesn't provide. Here, the question is ""limited"" in scope insofar as it refers to one event that has a clear beginning and end.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the question about the ""Resistance"" in Czechoslovakia in 1938 is open-ended. First of all, there was NO ""Resistance"" in Czechoslovakia in 1938 when it was still a (nominally) independent country. The Cezch part of the country was taken over in March 1939, and the Resistance was organized later. And when the OP writes ""I need to know what happened to the hero,"" whom did he meet, what would he have done, etc. it's like asking a ""homework question."" </p>

<p>An aspiring novelist is supposes to know these things! For us on SE to try to answer such a query is an invitation to a limitless set of answers. We would practically end up writing the novel itself, which is what we're NOT supposed to do on SE. A better question might be, would my hero have had a chance to meet President Benes at such and such a time and place. That, at least would be a question limited in scope.</p>

<p>I have recently come to the conclusion that a good answer on an SE has the property of ""Turing completeness,"" <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness</a> (i.e. comes to a halt). A good question will inspire ""Turing complete"" answers, while a bad one creates an ""infinite loop"" of answers. IMHO, the question has the latter, and not the former property.</p>

<p>""Large-n"" discursive analysis of documents (""texts"") in light of a tradition of reading-and-writing in a genre called scholarly history.  Theory is optional, but by preference is concealed beneath the narrative.  The unique element of historiography, as compared to other social science or humanities disciplines, it the attempt to read with veracity evidence of the past from very large collections of documents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are the distinctive methods of history?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A unique kind of reading and then writing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the difference between a professional historian and an amatuer?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A PhD, or positive reviews in a highly esteemed journal of a key monograph, or the publication of six or more papers in a highly esteemed journal.  Amateurs ""tend to get on with it"" at the cost of writing about irrelevances in poorly thought manners without an adequate source basis.  It generally <em>isn't</em> the selected subject matter.  I've been looking at local women's organisations and civic organisations as a potential area of interest.  But there's a gulf between my desire to historicise cross-class local provincial organisations compared to a list of names and local figures isolated from the context of mid-Twentieth century associationalism. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is counterfactual history? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Inverting a commonly accepted causal structure to test its causative properties by speculation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it merely applying legitimate historical methods to flawed and erroneous propositions? (e.g. The Great Game)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is more of a null-hypothesis test.  See, for example, Brooks' Sealion ( <a href=""http://www.philm.demon.co.uk/Miscellaneous/Sealion.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.philm.demon.co.uk/Miscellaneous/Sealion.htm</a> )</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do we study history? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ideally, do a BA Honours (Australian style) or BA+MA (Bologna), with a double major in History and a Language.  Then do a PhD.  Then start reading and writing based on further projects (the PhD ought to teach you how to select appropriate research projects).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are legitimate methods and sources? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>See a fourth year historiography text.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does history adapt when there are no sources?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It ceases to be.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps the most important question: What are some questions that can never be answered by historical sources and methods?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends on how you feel about a number of major humanities problems.  Can empirical work produce truth?  Can you read texts with veracity?  Importantly for the second sub-question: How?  Do you believe that it is possible to recreate hypothesised internal states in subjectivities through correct reading of the records of the subject's personality (psycho-history)?  Is it possible to accurately depict either in concrete or abstract the actual social forces of history via a correct reading of the records of the past (Thompson/Althusser debate)?  Do collective subjectivities exist, and if so are they the only body capable of a real knowledge of the actual process of capitalism (praxis/theory debate in Marxism)?  Is there a teleos?</p>

<p>History, like other empirical engagements with material reality, is the least worst possible way of uncovering conditional and limited knowledge about the world.  While it is dependent upon reading texts to produce meaning, there are a number of ways out of the quagmire of post-modernism/post-structuralism other than a constant quagmire of interdetermination.</p>

<p>As for answers, ""Rome fell because most of her soldiers at the end were mercentaries rather than citizens,"" is a bad answer, because it is (yours truly's) uninformed opinion, and the first question i bad because it provokes such an answer. A better, factual assertion is ""Edward Gibbons believed that Rome fell because most of her soldiers at the end were mercentaries rather than citizens,"" because the veracity of this can be checked by comparing it to what Gibbons actually wrote. Ths makes the second question ""good."" Or you could ask: True or false: ""Edward Gibbons believed that Rome fell because most of her soldiers at the end were mercentaries rather than citizens."" Another decent answer is ""in year XXX, Y% of the Roman army was composed of citizens, and Z% of mercenaries.""</p>

I am going to quote it here (remember, the question was, How much research is expected [of Stackoverflow users]): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lot. An absurd amount. More than you think you are capable of. In fact, asking a question on Stack Overflow is the absolute last thing you ever want to do. You want to avoid it at all costs. You want to think of it as a horrible shame* that will forever haunt you and pass down from you to your descendants. You want very much to find your
  answer some other way.</p>
  
  <p>You want to</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Search. Like mad.</li>
  <li>Test your code.</li>
  <li>Troubleshoot.</li>
  <li>Read blogs.</li>
  <li>Find books.</li>
  <li>Follow tutorials.</li>
  <li>Anything to avoid adding another question to Stack Overflow.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>You never want to hit that ""ask question"" button and absolutely <strong>never</strong> do you want to click the ""post your question"" button.</p>
  
  <p>After you have reached the end of your rope and the pain of not having the answer exceeds the vast amount of shame received by posting your question, that's when you can go ahead and ask. Because at that point, you will have done whatever research necessary to make it a good question worth asking. Because so help me, if your question gets an answer within 30 seconds that has 10 upvotes within 3 minutes, <strong>you did not do enough research</strong>.</p>
  
  <p><sub>* The terms ""shame"" and ""never"" are a tad bit hyperbolic, but the important point remains that we absolutely want you to do your homework. Understand that our time is not free, though we do not charge for it. Answering low quality, poorly researched, or duplicated questions becomes tiresome.</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would need a few minor adjustments to adapt to History Stack Exchange, but the point is clear enough, isn't it?</p>

<p>Now, admittedly, for some reason it is harder to <em>ask</em> a well-researched question than it is to give a well-researched <em>answer</em>. I found this out when comparing my two thoroughly researched Answers (on Roman slavery and Charles the Bold's nickname) with my lackadaisical American Mafia Question, which could have used a good deal more research. </p>

<p>So, for my next question I am presently knee-deep in research. I want to make sure that I've tried all the obvious things first before coming here.</p>

<p>Then again, maybe a majority of you don't care at all for what concerns me. Maybe you're happy to ask a constant streams of questions about something that could easily have been found on Wikipedia, receive upvotes, get a from-Wikipedia answer, give upvotes, and tomorrow you switch places.

I'd say it's safe to say that questions from amateurs are allowed and more often than not, enthusiastically welcomed. </p>

<p>That said, as <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/579/739"">T.E.D. noted</a>, we do expect questions to show at least some amount of prior research. We really don't want a site that's full of obvious answers, that would get extremely boring very fast. However it's extremely difficult to define a common baseline for the amount of prior research required. Each and every one of us has different standards, expectations and skills.</p>

<p>How do we maintain sanity, then? Well, that's easy, by combining our different standards, expectations and skills. It takes five votes from high(ish) rep users to close a question (i.e. deem it unsuitable), one or even four persons' opinions don't really mean much. I'd go as far as say that if you don't agree with one person's opinion of your question, you can just ignore it, at least until it becomes obvious what the community's opinion is. There's one notable exception, the people with diamonds next to their usernames; they are moderators exactly because we trust them to single handedly do stuff.</p>

<p>Although I don't think I'm in any way a representative user, just to give you an example, my workflow for determining prior research is a five minute search. I take the more important keywords from the question, enter them into Google and:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I find the answer, I'll downvote the question and move on (remember: a downvote's primary purpose is to show the post is ill researched or ill defined). </li>
<li>If I find relevant information (but not the answer), I will comment and share that information (primarily to help anyone else researching the question). If I feel that information would have made the question clearer and was relatively easy to find, I'll probably downvote. </li>
<li>If I don't find anything, I <em>may</em> upvote the question. </li>
<li>If I continue researching the question past the five minute threshold, I will most definitely upvote it. There aren't many questions that keep me interested for more than five minutes, and those that do deserve my upvote.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm guessing everyone has their own workflow, and I should note that (obviously) my workflow only applies to questions that aren't a mess to begin with. I wouldn't spend five minutes on rants (in disguise or not), <em>extremely</em> trivial questions and questions in broken English (on these, my five minutes are better spent in editing the question).</p>

<p>Both your questions pass my ""five minute test"". Obviously, the Australia one didn't pass someone else's equivalent test, but that's both understandable and expected. Some people on the site will be a lot more familiar with certain areas than others, and will be able to dig up relevant information and possibly the answer almost instantly. So what, as I've already mentioned, you shouldn't lose any sleep over what one person thinks.</p>

<p>Also, if you ignore the condescending tone of the comments, what remains is that someone familiar with the subject matter of your question answered it, almost immediately. I agree they could have been a bit nicer about it, but at the end of the day you found the information you were looking for. That's not so bad, is it? </p>

<p>Of course, I'm not suggesting that the ends justify the means. The comments, although not outright rude, weren't particularly helpful and you could have just flagged them. Or, just ignore them. But saying that ""I do not think I will be able to write to the standards this site requires without getting an abrupt and condescending comment"" is an overreaction. I'd strongly advise against letting a single bad experience shape your opinion of the site, especially since you have found at least some value on the site (more specifically, the answer to your other question). </p>

<p>Stick around, and give the site another chance. Keep in mind that it's extremely tough to convey emotion in comments. The person at the other end of the line might just be tired, or having a bad day, or whatever, and they screwed up with their comment. Or you might just be misinterpreting the comments. It doesn't matter, whatever the reason for a not so friendly comment, if it's just one (or even two), just ignore it.</p>

references a timeframe that is indeterminate, or a timeframe that

<p>Update:  @DVK's assertion lingers in my mind and forces me to clarify that the key to why I believe these to be off topic is the absence of sources/citations.  If the questions are based on sources, then they're on topic. If they don't have sources, then these aren't questions about history, they're invitations to dialogue, or politics, or religion or something else. The difference between a meeting of historians and a meeting of a professional debate society is the respect and attention paid to the sources.  </p>

<p>One of the difficulties for autodidacts in the humanities, as opposed to the sciences, is that there is often no right answer. As such, if you want to pass yourself off as an expert historian you pretty much only need to be well-read and able to rattle off sources.

<p>If there was a pattern to the rejections it was because I felt there was a dangerous ambiguity in the text.  Unfortunately enough time has gone by that I don't remember the details, but I remember looking at one of the texts and thinking, ""I can see what he <em>meant</em> to say, but I'm not sure that it says that.""  I remember thinking that it was the kind of sentence that I could see myself writing, and then being pilloried for not spotting the ambiguity.  I really wished I could have offered an constructive suggestion or edit rather than a rejection. As I said, I meant to go back and try to fix that, but got distracted by a shiny paycheck.</p>

<p>Tags are constrained to be very brief, and sometimes that brevity seems to facilitate misunderstanding.  When the subject is contentious, any misunderstanding can lead to the kind of fractious debate that undermines SE.  I wish I could remember the details, but I do recall rejecting your first attempt at a summary tag for Jews, and then approving the second because it was much clearer. </p>

<p>In any case I'm glad you asked for the feedback - the site doesn't offer the chance to offer feedback on tag wiki content.

I've noted that most mods here have different standards for comment flags than are found on other sites. Because of such, nearly half of my comment flags have been declined, mostly obsolete and chatty flags. I've mostly given up flagging comments here except for blatantly rude comments. </p>

<p>For example, I've flagged comments suggesting the author change something in the post after the author has made the said changes as obsolete. However, they have been repeatedly declined.  As I understand it, comments are of ephemeral importance. Once they've fulfilled their purpose (in this case notifying the author of needed changes), they are obsolete. They are just noise. On other sites, I generally flag these as obsolete, but I've given up doing that here. </p>

<p>Other examples of comments that I see as too chatty or obsolete are ""+1 nice answer"", ""@user I've made the changes"" (after the user has been given a chance too read it of course), or ""happy new year"". I've flagged comments like these and all have been declined. </p>

<p>I think comments are influenced by the culture of the community. If new joiners see a lot of &quot;Thank you&quot; comments they may feel obliged to thank the answerer themselves. I did this myself (even though I knew it was in stark contrast from other SEs I had been active on).</p>
<p>If we start flagging these comments and cleaning them up then this culture will slowly start to change and one day we will find they have stopped coming in so frequently.</p>
<p>Here particularly, because of the nature of the subject, I believe extended discussions will happen from time to time --especially on areas that have not yet been extensively researched. This will, therefore, put a lot of comments in the &quot;obsolete&quot; category.</p>
<h2>Where do I stand?</h2>
<p>I agree with the OP. Chatty comments such as &quot;thank you&quot;, &quot;me too&quot;, &quot;I disagree, -1&quot; do not really add to the quality of the post. We should only allow comments that really improve the quality of the post (e.g., those that point out problems with a post/other comment, or those that add extra information --to be used when the commentator has no edit privileges or wants to discuss the edit first, or those that explain why someone down voted a post etc.).</p>
<h3><em>How practical will this be?</em></h3>
<p>Remember the number of comments posted daily far exceeds the number of posts/edits made. While flagging comments cleans up the website, I think it should not set a precedent for future moderators to clean them up religiously.</p>
<p>So I would vote that we should definitely continue flagging &quot;thank you&quot; styled comments but wait and see what other moderators say on flagging obsolete comments.</p>

<p>Many questions include an implicit assumption of agency that is fallacious.  There is no world community – at least not a world community with an executive and a club that can be used to punish people or to bake birthday cakes.

<p>If your question begins &quot;How many…&quot;, you're probably asking for a list, and you shouldn't ask that here. There are exceptions – &quot;How many years did the 1812 war last?&quot;, or &quot;How many patents did G. W. Carver have?&quot;</p>
<p>Double check that you're asking for a &quot;closed answer&quot; – an answer, not a list. Then see if there is a way to rephrase the question so that it is really what you want.  Sometimes this question is phrased as &quot;What were the … names of people on the Titanic?&quot;</p>
<h3>When did you stop beating your wife? (e.g. What is the timeframe for Adam and Eve?)</h3>
<p>There are two problems with these questions. First, the timeframe isn't mentioned. If you're asking about behavior X in Roman History, the answer is generally meaningless unless you specify what period of Roman History.  &quot;What is the role of a censor in Roman government?&quot;  Depends on whether we're talking empire, republic, late empire, or June 7, 45 BCE.  &quot;Who is the Secretary of State?&quot; Depends on which administration, and which year.</p>
<p>The other problem is questions that rely on assumptions – like the assumption that I beat my wife, or that I'm married. <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/8875/1401"">Example 1</a>, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/434/1401"">Example 2</a>.</p>
<p>Before you ask the question, first, specify a time period, and if possible an event. It is much easier to provide a comprehensive answer if you specify an event; we can research the causes and effects of that event and discuss them intelligently.  Second, doublecheck that the majority of the people accept all the assumptions.  Sometimes this will cause me to eat crow; there are questions where the assumptions aren't obvious.  But it is worth your while to take a moment to make sure that all the terms  in your question are meaningful to the audience.</p>
<h3>Can you evaluate the impact of Sujarkama's theory of mesonic exchange entitlements on the gross national product of the Jawethi province of Kronos under Reaganomics?</h3>
<p>If you ask a question which relies on obscure details, <strong>without citing those details</strong> I will downvote you.

Show that research. If you're asking about Pokemon, or Obelisks, or Soviet Watches, then show me the references. When I'm checking the references, I may spot the connections that eluded you, or I may be able to spot the reason why there is no connection.   If you're asking about your thesis concerning Roman syncretism, then provide some evidence of that syncretism.

<p>Questions are based on unfounded, suspicious or unsourced premises tend to get closed. Even if they don't get closed, they tend to accumulate a great deal of debate/discussion/argument that reduces the chance that the question will get an authoritative answer.   If you want an answer to your question, cite all non-trivial assumptions. Then go ahead and cite the ones that you think are trivial, because the worst that will happen is that someone will learn something.</p>
<h3>If you must</h3>
<p>Before you post a question, make sure that you've provided sources for each of the assertions you make. Comments should (politely) ask OP to provide sources/citations/evidence for questionable assumptions/assertions.</p>
<p>Include the <strong>citations in the question</strong>; don't ask people to wade through a long comment stream to find a citation, and then to ask them to infer which noun in the question relates to the citation.   You're asking people to do research on your behalf; make it easier for them.</p>

Five should have been extensively edited before they were released.  (fortunately, H:SE is relatively good about community editing to refine a question; I think we could evolve to do better, but I think we do OK).

<p>In hindsight I feel the question (though being the first result on Google for ""<a href=""http://www.google.com.hk/#safe=off&amp;q=ancient+medieval+india+law&amp;oq=ancient+medieval+india+law&amp;gs_l=serp.3...4475.5964.1.6144.9.9.0.0.0.0.165.519.7j2.9.0....0...1c.1.21.serp.frnw6A3Shl4&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.&amp;bvm=bv.49478099,d.aGc,pv.xjs.s.en_US.c75bKy5EQ0A.O&amp;fp=25e80abc3d71398d&amp;biw=1392&amp;bih=802"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ancient medieval india law</a>"") is too broad to be meaningfully answered in a small HSE standard post.</p>

<p>I have edited the question so that it focuses only on the period between the late Iron ages and early middle ages of India. I have done this because I think I should have posted two different questions --one for each period. My theory is that that this will attract more answers from people who may not be knowledgable about both periods. My other question on late middle period will follow later.</p>

<p>What is the opinion of the community on this approach?</p>

<p>No one gets to infect a site with rants of any kind, Nazi or otherwise. Similarly, one doesn't have the right to proselytize their political views, religion, phobias or hate in a manner that disrupts the purpose of the site. That falls under our golden rule of basically <em>not being a jerk</em>. If your behavior, however passive is causing a disruption, that behavior needs to stop.</p>

<p>I've examined this user's profile at least a dozen times, reading it from beginning to end as many. For the sake of discussion, let's ignore the fact that the person that wrote this profile indicated that they were 13 years old. On the Internet, no one knows that ... well, you get the gist.</p>

<p>Please read the rest in its entirety before reacting.</p>

<p>The first set of questions I asked was, <em>what does this profile not do</em>?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It does not use profanity or vulgarity, though many <em>will</em> associate certain words it contains with vulgar people or ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not directly attack any individual based on on their religion, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or anything else. It does, however state that certain religions are inferior. While he may have insulted the <em>institution</em> of several religions, he's not <em>directly</em> insulting anyone for simply belonging to them.</p></li>
<li>It no longer displays a swastika. </li>
</ul>

<p>I'm putting my personal beliefs and feelings aside while writing this, as a Stack Exchange community manager it is my job to be <em>completely</em> objective in such evaluations, even at the cost of being wildly unpopular for doing so. This was a difficult decision to make. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, it's the <em>reception</em> of the text that creates needless angst and disruptions within the community. This isn't the first time we've been contacted regarding the text and we <em>only</em> alter a user's profile when we feel that interceding is <em>absolutely</em> necessary. Any technicality one could raise does not alter the fact that the <em>intent of the writing was to be deliberately hurtful</em> or <em>hateful</em>, even just from the vantage point of the offended.</p>

<p>Note, not <em>all</em> of the text was removed, only the portion that I found to be the most egregious and deliberately offensive to people of certain religions.</p>

<p>It's not a bad question but Americans may not realise how dumb the title sounds to British ears. ""Poofy"" and ""pants"" are each problematic but could probably stand alone (and be correctly mentally translated by a British reader). But combine them in a title and it's ... er ... just <em>terrible</em>. I'm guessing it'd be the equivalent in American English of talking about ""faggoty underpants"" or ""gay boxers"". </p>

<p>Could we replace it in the title with ""puffy trousers"" or ""jodhpur style uniform"" or <em>something</em>?</p>

<p>But feeling like that, as a Brit, probably makes me the worst person to fix it, so I haven't touched it. And folks are entitled I think to have their ""flavour"" of English respected and not edited into a different version. In some ways it would be better done by an American. Since I don't want to start a UK English v. American English edit war. Which is why I suggest it here.</p>

  <p>""A Moderate amount of research can give you at least three

<p>I see a problem here: Today, with Wikipedia, Google, etc, there is virtually no question that cannot be answered by ""googling it"", if you know how and what to look for. If so, why do we need this site at all? How much ""googling"" and surfing around Wikipedia is required before one poses a question? An hour? 5 hours? A week? </p>

<p>Are only questions whose answers can be found exclusively in books or very obscure sources valid for the site, but something requiring only ""moderate research"" is not appropriate?</p>

<p><strong>IMO the value of this site is two-fold:</strong></p>

<p>1) It serves as a centralized repository for validated/expert answers about questions of History.</p>

<p>2) It allows those of us who are less informed about History, such that we might have to ""google"" for days or weeks before coming upon the correct answer, to avail ourselves of the knowledge of experts, who either know the answer from their own studies, and/or because of their <strong>expertise</strong>, know how and what to ""google"" to get a solid, correct answer.</p>

However, when those questions start asking for ""other sources"" or ""other examples"", they start to cross over into a range of questions that we try to discourage on the site. The example you gave of a question asking ""how widespread"" is another example that starts to cross the line. While I would agree that for many questions, there may not be ""one best answer"". our ultimate goal is to try to find just that ONE best answer. </p>

<p>The question you cited as an example is fairly new and probably has not been viewed by any of the moderators, myself included. It's very difficult for us to read and evaluate every single question, but we usually manage to get around to them all eventually. For something like this, I would usually ask the original poster to modify the question to make it more appropriate with our guidelines. </p>

<p>Ultimately, there is a specific standard that has been established for all SE sites, and we ask that everyone adhere to that standard. It is certainly your privilege to disagree with the guidelines, but if it truly bothers you, it is also your privilege to move along. </p>

When people start abusing the comments to carry on a discussion or debate, we will close that question to further comments or simply delete all the comments. </p>

<p>Now, if you will excuse me, I have to go and attend to 16 flags that have been posted, most of them by you. In a really bad week we normally have about four total, so seeing 16 just over the last couple of days is disturbing. Please do not use the comments or flags as your own form of discussion or debate for any answers or questions.

Take the following question:
<a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/651/why-are-many-african-nations-poor"">Why are so many African countries poor?[closed]</a> </p>

<p>Let me show how the question is misguided and could be redirected:</p>

<p>African countries are poor because they live in a fatalistic and corrupt culture where people cannot get ahead in life due to the viscious cycles of poverty directly connected to their culture, and religion, which for some is Islam, some Christianity, and some Voodoo/Spiritism. The cycle of poverty is itself a huge topic involving countless factors. </p>

<p>It would be nice if I could post an explanation telling the guy that he would be better off studying poverty cycles in general than history. He needs to be redirected to poverty cycles. However, I cannot tell him that because the question is ""closed."" Even though I have 2k rep I can't communicate to him how to approach his problem. </p>

<p>Either instead of or in addition to closing questions we should explain how to approach the question and ""redirect"" them towards the proper topic. </p>

<p>This is a helpful alternative to stonewalling inquisitive minds. I'm not saying closing is bad, I'm saying that closing should at least leave the door open to suggestions on how to approach the problem effectively. </p>

<p><strong>Basically: our ""closed"" questions should be comparable to where encyclopedias don't have an entry but refer the reader to another word where the desired information is found.</strong> </p>

<p>Some questions are irredeemable and re-direction is unfeasible such as trivia questions about hallmark cards. For those we could merely say something like, ""Historians on Stack Exchange are unfamiliar with Hallmark cards due to their trivial nature and lack of historical relevance, please search elsewhere on the internet.""  </p>

<p>I was one of the downvoters for the ""colonial masters"" questions, and I confess that after I hit the downvote and close the question stayed in my mind.  I realized that in fact the question wasn't subjective; that I have read references to scholarly articles that made precisely this claim.  I had a knee jerk reaction to phrases like ""colonial masters"" that are not infrequently used irresponsibly.</p>

<p>I'm not going to agree with @Vector's tone or presentation, nor defend use of flags, etc. I am most explictly not going to argue against @Steven Drennon's response, which I think is correct and useful. </p>

<p>I do think that there is an issue we should examine.  History is a subtle subject, full of complexity, contradiction and unreliable reporters.  Historians frequently disagree with one another; there are many many historical subjects for which there is no single best answer.  (and the answers change; when I was growing up, Whig History was popular. When I was in college, Marxist development distory was the  One True Faith. Today we have different trends).  </p>

<p>SE has a different aesthetic/culture/preference.  SE arises from more technical environments where there is more likely to be a single best answer. </p>

<p>Each SE site can and does differentiate from the core principles. <strong>However</strong> I think that if we are to be successful at departing from the core principles, we need to clearly document how, why and what the limits are. </p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/"">Subjective vs Objective</a>.  I do not think there is a simple answer to this question. History is going to be more subjective than (for example) security.stackexchange.com.  We need to develop and continuously refine our own definition of good subjective and counterproductive subjective.  I <em>suspect</em> that H:SE's interpretation of good subjective includes answers based on phrases like ""success of the resulting state is a subjective term, but if we allow GDP to stand in as a measure for success, then...."" If you'll permit me to abuse my own example, then I'll quickly point out that such answers lead inevitably to disagreement, and Lists.</li>
<li><a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/667/1401"">Lists</a>.   (I'll move this to that question if it is deemed more productive). History is an ongoing discussion of multiple correct answers.  I <em>do not</em> have an answer as to how we can reconcile the practice of history with SE preference for single best answers.  I believe it is worth examining the problem, developing and continuously refining an answer.  </li>
<li>Respect. Respectful language, respectful comments, respectful questions. We need to be very careful to be civil and respectful to one another, and to those affected by the questions.  I now admit that I was unjust to ""knee jerk"" in response to ""colonial masters"", but I'd just read another question that bordered on racial profiling.  <strong>NOTE WITH EMPHASIS</strong>  I recognize that many participants on H:SE are either (a) not native English speakers, and therefore not aware of the subtle implications of some phrases - ""poofy pants"" comes to mind as an example of a phrase that wasn't intended to offend or amuse, but which has a different meaning in different cultures.  We have to live with that reality (b) some of the participants are new to history and aren't aware of some of the groundwork. I made those same erroneous assumptions when I was just starting to study history. We have to be respectful when we point out that the world is more complicated.  (c) legitimate differences of opinion.  @Samuel Russell &amp; I come from very different assumption sets; it would be very difficult for us to hold a conversation on many historical topics because we don't agree on the fundamentals. (Once he used the term ""valorization"", I realized that we simply wouldn't bridge the gap.) I don't think he's wrong, I just think he applies a different set of assumptions and methods to analyze history.  I prefer my assumptions and methodologies.  Fortunately we've been very respectful of one another, and I'd be happy to buy him a beer and discuss any non-economic issue.  I'll upvote his answers in many cases because they are well researched, well thought through, and well written.  Sometimes I'll upvote his, and then add my own answer because although I respect his opinion, I simply come from a different place.  (Aside: that makes it very difficult for H:SE to identify ""one best answer"").</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not going to pretend that I have any of the answers, but I do think that we should ponder @Vector's question.  Personally, I find the tone to be a bit more provocative than I find useful, but if I read past that, I think there is an important question.</p>

Such style of questions are commonly asked on Stack Overflow and no one has any issue (e.g. ""here is my code snippet, what am I doing wrong?"" questions are fine on SO).

<p>Having said that, in my opinion, the stack exchange model is a bit of a myth; it is an aspiration or goal that we use to define our common culture.  It is possible to depart from the SE model and remain within SE, but only if you can actively define how you're going to solve the problem. (I can't find the reference right now, but one of the high reputation moderators pointed out that many SE sites have managed to build successful sites that diverge from key elements of the SE model mythology).  </p>

<p>The SE ""single answer myth"" is important; it is part of what separates us from discussion sites, and what makes us (we hope) a valuable <strong>reference</strong>.  We don't want to abandon that myth without a substitute myth that is more effective for what we want to build. History is not about single answers - (except in trivial cases).  History involves dialogue between different schools of thought. The 'single answer myth' is antithetical to the concept of scientific investigiation. </p>

<li>Do not discourage discussion and/or debate</li>

<ol>
<li>The OP explicitly identify how the ""correct"" answer will be identified</li>
<li>List responders accept that their answer may be correct, but not selected</li>
<li>We all accept responsibility for moving debate/discussion to chat or meta</li>

<p>The great tragedy is that these questions are, in my opinion, simple to transform into valuable questions. <strong>Provide your source</strong>.   If you're asking about a historical figure, provide a link to that historical figure.  Not only do you vastly increase the value of the site as a reference source and learning aid, but you may disambiguate the question.  There are many historical figures who are known by different names, and many that share the same name.  If you're wondering about some historical theory, then provide a link to that theory. If you provide me a link to an interesting historical theory that I've never heard of, then I'll upvote your question, praise you publicly and instruct the network of telepathic goldfish to send good vibrations your way.  But more importantly, if you include the relevant details in your question, you increase your chances of getting a good answer. </p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/9974/1401"">Jesus in India</a>  - My objection is <strong>not</strong> about religion; my object is that the question asks for evidence about a theory that (as far as we know) is only in OP's mind.  ""What evidence is there that Jesus visited Schenetady N.Y.? What evidence is there that Mithradates visited London?""  </p>

<p>@Vector did some research and found what plausibly was the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_India_%28book%29#The_discovery"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a> that OP was thinking of, and I think that @Vector deserves multiple upvotes for rescuing the question and for research an answer.  But since OP chose to ask the question as a guessing game, we don't know if that is the source, or if  the OP received telepathic messages from a nearby goldfish.  </p>

<h3>Counterexample</h3>

<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/9984/1401"">This question</a> (singer and applause) is different; @Voitcus admits that memory is the issue, and even provides some details of the research that he's done. There is even a hypothesis that we're invited (implicitly) to help prove/disprove.  </p>

<p>Or look at <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/1/1401"">The Eastern Question</a>; @JFW takes the time to offer definitions of the terms used in the question and the context.  I learned something just reading the question, which is kind of cool. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, a vote represents the opinion of a user, to identify whether a question is <strong>useful</strong> or <strong>not useful</strong> in addition to points about clarity and research and whatnot. Voting is the tool for the community as a whole to judge posts. It is as much to identify when a question is poorly written as it is to identify that the problem being asked about... really isn't worth anyone's time. There are ultimately three states to a vote, though, and there's always the option to simply ""not vote"" when you think a question is not very helpful in your own analysis but figure that others may find it worthwhile or helpful when pursuing that route. Basically, if a post qualifies as ""not interesting enough to upvote"", you're valid to not vote on it instead to express the lack of interest, and a downvote is unnecessary unless you feel it is a negative to the site.</p>

<p>You're not downvoting just to express your opinion. You're downvoting to express your opinion on the validity of a topic to the community. Taking a personal voting grudge on, say, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/china"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;china&#39;"" rel=""tag"">china</a> here because you loathe the country and everyone in it, that would be petty. You may still vote as such, as it is your opinion to give, but it's not a very healthy way to go about voting.</p>

<p>But if there was a subject matter on which you feel that dealing with questions about them is not useful to <em>anyone in the community</em>, then from that you could downvote against questions of that subject matter. This would be because, moreso than your personal hatred for the subject matter, you're voting because you don't believe the question to be valuable to anyone, which is inline with how one should be voting at all times. It shouldn't be ""I don't like this"", it should be ""This isn't useful to the site"". Typically, subjects that would get identified in this way usually end up being the subject of topicality discussions - if there's a community consensus that a particular subject is toxic to the site, then it makes sense to bar the subject.</p>

<p>I'm not fond of murder and the like either, though I personally stay out of news often just to not dwell on it. So I can understand your dislike of seeing those kinds of questions. However, I don't personally think it's a subject matter that's harmful to the community as a whole to discuss, so I don't feel that downvoting everything is healthy, neither to the community nor to you as a voter. <strong>There is a more applicable course of action for you, though - ignored tags</strong>. In your profile, there's a tab in the top right that says 'prefs', which you may use to identify one or more tags as ""ignored tags"". These will be greyed out when they show up or, if you mark the appropriately labelled ""hide ignored tags"" checkbox on the same page, hidden altogether from your view as you browse. Using this would let you navigate the site entirely without needing to acknowledge this subject matter, while not inhibiting the abilities of other users to partake in their own millings-about with the topic. It would also avoid the otherwise necessary viewing of such questions to begin with that downvoting would require.</p>

I'm sure there are exceptions to this rule, but that is the snap judgment I would make.

For me, especially, it is harder to read a text with spelling errors, but a native speaker could give assistance to the poster, there is a chat, or you can ask him/her to write the text in OP's native language and help to translate.</p>

<p>This community is intended to share knowledge and help solving problems, why shouldn't we assist in asking questions too?</p>

<p>Of course this is when the language problems are obvious; somebody who writes poorly because of his laziness can be down-voted, but if it is that somebody used wrong word, wrote ""I had asking"" or something like this, I think such help is always welcome.</p>

<p>One of the places that H:SE can really shine is when we provide answers to questions that are fiendishly difficult to research in traditional sources.  Sometimes this invovles </p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10166/1401"">What color are tracer rounds</a> I'm not sure where you'd look this up, but H:SE provides not only an answer, but details that would help to interpret the source. Note that OP has provided a source, asked a precise question, and implicitly has considered how the question could be answered.</li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/8022/1401"">How far could an English War Bow Shoot</a> This is the kind of thing that <em>can</em> be found in books, but once again, interpretation of the source (credibility, completeness, etc.) is greatly facilitated by a practitioner of the art.  OP has supplied a source (and implicitly has consulted others) and clearly expressed the reservations about the source. Not a perfect question, but IMHO a good fit for H:SE.</li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/5862/1401"">How long to forge a sword</a> - another question where there are sources, but sources tend to neglect to mention critical details, or assume that the researcher has background skills &amp; knowledge that are not common. OP clearly identifies some of the terms that are making interpretation of the answers difficult (and again, implicitly demonstrates that research has been done.)</li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/8609/1401"">How were swords worn in the 18th century?</a>  OP specifies the constraints that are confusing, the experiments that have been tried and the resulting confusion. OP also implicitly recognizes that there are those of us who wear swords and can speak to the issue. I suspect there are textual sources, but any costumer will tell you that textual sources require a wealth of experience to interpret.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Implications</h2>

<p>This is an example of a pattern that doesn't have a lot of implications, except to feel free to ask H:SE unusual questions.</p>

<p>Ask H:SE questions where it is difficult to interpret the source material without background that is non-trivial to obtain. (few of us have the ability to shoot tracer rounds or forge a sword, and even if we did, it wouldn't really be meaningful without years of practice).</p>

<p>If you see an H:SE question that relies on unusual expertise, refer the question to those who might have that expertise. </p>

<p>I realize that there are image search engines, but I haven't found them mature yet.  The best image recognition engine is still the human mind.  H:SE is a good place to crowdsource questions that rely on images.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/8244/could-you-help-me-identify-this-photograph-that-was-taken-shortly-after-world-wa"">What is this photograph?</a> One of my favorite H:SE questions &amp;
answers.  Even though OP didn't cite prior research or provide a
context, the truth is that sometimes we're provided with evidence &amp;
sources out of context, and we don't know how/where to start the
research.  Not only did OP get two answers, but they provided context
and identified some of the reasons why research was challenging.</li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10116/1401"">What is the cable in this image?</a> - OP provides source and a very
specific question.  H:SE provides multiple answers that rely on both
photo interpretation and subject matter specific expertise.</li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/8683/1401"">What uniform is this?</a> - I don't know how else to get an answer
to this.  Note that OP has provided the source of the image and
enough context to help researchers to evaluate the answer.  But also
note that I think the answer is provided by not by image search, but
by people who are experts in what is arguably an obscure subject.</li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/8707/what-shoulder-straps-are-these"">What are these shoulder straps?</a> - I'll grant you this was solved
with google image search, but I think it still fits within the
category.</li>

<p>Two relatively high rep people on the site tried to answer the question with either direct, or indirect references to Kipling's poem, ""Take up the white man's burden."" This attracted criticism and downvotes for ""not answering the question.""</p>

<p>But one commenter had this opinion (which I endorse): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""It is bizarre to answer the question without referring to the poem... It would be like discussing the phrase ""government of the people, by the people, for the people"" as if there had never been a Gettysburg Address and Lincoln had never lived.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe that an extremely sophisticated questioner could use a quote independently of its original context by defining ""his version"" of the quote. But the OP did not fall into this category. He was a first time user, who appeared to be ""fishing"" for an answer.</p>

<p>I almost wanted to edit the question by inserting a link to the poem in the question. Should I have done this? I decided instead to lead by example and cite the poem in the answer, answering what I believe was the OP's ""implicit"" question. Was I wrong to do this?</p>

<p>Could the question have been answered a ""better"" way? Or was the issue was that the question was bad?</p>

<p>To my mind the phrase ""White Man's burden"" is rather more on the side of Jingoism.

<p>My biggest problem with the question was that the terms in the question weren't defined. Any answer based on ill-defined terms is, in effect, a discussion, not an answer.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>""middle class"" is a modern term with no definition.  In practice ""middle class"" is used to mean ""earns roughly as much as I do"".  I have acquaintances earning middle six figure incomes who own their own business and claim to be ""middle class"".  The term has no meaning and therefore the question is opinion based.</p></li>
<li><p>The economic system of Rome in 1CE isn't like the modern economic system; they had a defined ""class"" system, which is very different from the American ""class"" system, or the British ""class"" system.  Was the carpenter a citizen? an equite? a member of the urban tribes?  A resident of Rome?  Urban or rural? Citizen of a client state?  Probably most important of all, did the carpenter in question have a patron, and who was the patron?  A wealthy carpenter at the top of his trade who was the client of a weak patron had a lower status than a middling carpenter with a strong patron.  An unemployed citizen whose father was a carpenter had a higher status than a very wealthy and skilled slave. (I realize that some of these are improbable).</p></li>

<p>With all the undefined terms, the question is a little like asking whether the taste of green is similar to the scent of the number 3.  Anyone can answer the question, and there is no way to tell which answer is better.  </p>

<h2>How does a post become a Community Wiki post?</h2>
<p>There are several ways a question or answer can enter community wiki
mode, and most of these ways will occur automatically based on the
rules of the system.</p>
<p>Posts enter community wiki mode when one of the following happens:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The body of the post has been edited by at least five (<strong>5</strong>) different users.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The post has been edited ten (<strong>10</strong>) times by the original owner.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>answer</strong>'s author checks the <em>community wiki</em> checkbox when composing the answer. Note that this checkbox isn't available to new
users.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>answer</strong> is edited by its original author, who when doing so opts to check the <em>community wiki</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An answer posted to a Community Wiki question will also be Community Wiki. Note that when a question is made CW after answers have already
been posted, the existing answers are not normally converted to CW
automatically.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The question generates more than <strong>30</strong> answers (<strong>15</strong> on Super User, <strong>60</strong> on Code Golf). In this case, the question and all answers
will enter community mode, as will any future answers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A moderator has reason to believe that the <strong>question</strong> serves better in community wiki mode - if you believe your question <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/the-future-of-community-wiki/"">should
be

<p>A history site needs to handle a number of classes of question with care:</p>

<ul>
<li>Politics (in the sense of answers having implications in current political struggles)</li>
<li>Conspiracy theories</li>
<li>Perceptions of minorities</li>
<li>Religion (especially when touching on the existence of God and miracles)</li>
<li>Popular philosophy</li>
</ul>

<p>The extremely polarizing topics have a strong tendency to attract the wrong sort of audience: people who care more about the subject than they do about the study of history.</p>

<p>In the view of many participants on this site <em>all</em> questions about Jesus are, by definition, opinion-based.  The top-voted answer to <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/7907/can-the-new-testament-be-a-valid-historical-record-on-the-real-life-of-jesus"">Can the new testament be a valid historical record on the real life of Jesus?</a> boils down to: scholars are divided.  There are enough questions about the validity of religious texts that many people dismiss them as historical sources.  Therefore if you ask about events in the New Testament that are not <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/4214/3252"">found in other sources</a>, the only possible answers are opinion-based.</p>

<p>Now, I happen to disagree with that approach.  For one thing, I find <a href=""http://christianity.blogoverflow.com/2012/04/09/easter-as-a-historical-event/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">strong evidence</a> that the early Christian writings were based on eyewitness accounts. For another, it's a double standard.  (We accept all sorts of self-serving and politically-motivated documents as having historical value, so why not religiously-biased texts?)  Every bit of historical evidence should have it's day in court and be judged on it's own merits.  Lumping all religious sources into a single blob is, in my opinion, poor (and perhaps, lazy) history.</p>

<p>But my opinion is less important than <strong>our opinion</strong>.  As a group, the consensus is that asking about Jesus is more trouble than it's worth. However, the rephrased question about the economic status of a generic Galilean carpenter, er <a href=""https://christianity.stackexchange.com/q/4896/914"">builder</a>, under Roman rule can be answered (in theory) without reliance on religious sources.  It's not the choice I would have made, but it seems to be where this site has landed.</p>

<h2>Different sites have different rules.</h2>

<p>I can imagine variations on this question being asked on at least four sites:</p>

<ol>
<li>History,</li>
<li><a href=""https://christianity.stackexchange.com/"">Christianity</a>,</li>
<li><a href=""https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/"">Biblical Hermeneutics</a>, and</li>
<li><a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/"">Skeptics</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>But each site has its own <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/03/respect-the-community-your-own-and-others/"">cultural standards</a>, so the question would need to be asked differently on different sites.  For instance, I <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/11476289#11476289"">asked</a> a regular on Biblical Hermeneutics who told me that the original version would fit there if it included the relevant New Testament references (Matthew 13:55 &amp; Mark 6:3).  It would be harder (but possible, I suspect) to ask on Skeptics and, perhaps, easier to ask on Christianity.  The key is to know your audience.</p>

<p>Also, it would help if you'd been more careful with terminology, as <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/771/690"">Mark C. Wallace</a> mentioned.</p>

<h2>How to avoid the downvote</h2>

<li><p>Search H:SE.<br />

If you've got a new variation of the question or something new to ask, then explicitly cite the previous question to show that you are aware that the question has been asked before, and make it clear how your question is different.<br />
If you ask a longwinded question that appears to be a duplicate of one of these two, I'm going to downvote.<br />
I probably should feel guilty about this, but to be honest, I don't.</p>

<li><p>Re-read your question.<br />
Are there any terms in your question that would not be familiar to your average sixth grader?  To your mother-in-law? If so, search Wikipedia and include a link to the term.  Yes, I'm aware that many of you loathe Wikipedia with a passion that rivals a divorce settlement or the thirty years war.  If you fall into that group, then provide a citation to some other source, but make it a source that someone can check. The goal in this step is to provide references to clarify your question if it isn't quite as clear in text as it is in your mind.  If you think Wikipedia falls short of the goal, then clarify the outstanding issues in your question.</p>

Research is not limited; if you share it, you've still got it.  If you don't share your research, then you're asking me to play a guessing game, and you're really providing a huge disincentive to answering your question.  If you've searched Wiki &amp; google &amp; standard source X, then mention that.  Explain why those answers were inadequate.  (Many other sites require this and will pre-emptively close your question if you don't do this; I wish we included that in our culture).</p>

<li><p>Re-read your question again.<br />
Have you established that you're asking about something real?  Just to pick a random example, does your question assume that the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation_of_Constantine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Donation of Constantine</a> is a genuine document?  If your question relies on false premises, it is unlikely to result in a good question.</p>

Better to rely on comments and flags.</p>

<p>To act otherwise is perhaps fraught with ""moral hazard"": </p>

<ul>
<li>Nobody can claim complete impartiality - the risk of editorializing
is always there, although it may be unintentional. What one considers a ""bad bit"" may not be so for others. Having worked as a professional translator, I am all too cognizant of how seemingly innocent modifications and interpretations potentially breed far-reaching ""unintended consequences"". The question's terminology itself: <em>""questions and answers that are good, or OK, except that they contain some little bits of nonsense or offensiveness""</em> demonstrates that a subjective judgment has already been made regarding the post, even before the editing begins. If so, subsequent edits of the sort under dicussions are danger-fraught.</li>
<li>Such editing may be the result of misunderstanding the OP's intent.</li>
<li>At the moment, the policy on SE (AFAIK) is that editors have no
accountability for their edits in terms of reputation: If one makes a
substantial change to a post, they may impact the reputation of the
poster at no risk to their own reputation, although through such an
edit they have ""taken ownership"" of that post to some extent. IMO
there is some inherent inequity here.</li>
</ul>

<p>By way of suggestion, perhaps such a policy should be taken into consideration: If a member edits a post that is not subject to peer review, in a manner which effects the substance of that post, the editor in question should bear some accountability for potential impacts on the poster's reputation, perhaps by binding the editor's reputation to that post, to an extent which reflects the degree of their edit.</p>

<p><em><strong>Admittedly, such a policy would be very difficult to automate, because it requires qualitative analysis of each particular edit within the context of the post in question, and to put such a burden on moderators is not viable.</em></strong></p>

<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10162/1401"">Are the Samaritans descendants of Israel's lost tribes, and so rightfully considered Israelites?</a>
I don't like this question. There is a citation, but the citation doesn't clarify the issue. There is insufficient material here for me to learn anything.  This question is almost too narrow for H:SE.   Beyond the definitions question, there is an underlying problem. Effectively the question is asking ""Should I accept the assertions of Authority X or Authority Y about a question where Authority Y is the recognized authority?""<br>
Google provides answers that are significantly inferior to those on H:SE - the first three don't answer the question and the fifth drops off into fringe speculation.  </li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10005/1401"">How was Abd al-Rahman I recognized when he arrived in Islamic Spain?</a>
This is an interesting question, clearly phrased.  The question references uncited research, but there is enough information to understand the basis of the question.
Google provides no useful results.
The answer given is ... less than satisfactory. It is probably true, contains a citation, but doesn't contain enough information to understand the answer. Effectively the answer is little more than an assertion. This is a pity because without more information, the answer is of little use to anyone.</li>

<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10152/1401"">Why was the water in roman fountains cold?</a>
The question is clear, but should have been edited (""roman"" should be ""Roman"")
There are no comprable answers on google.
H:SE provided good answers with references.</li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10130/1401"">Was the German Empire responsible for the advancement of german
technology?</a>
I dislike this question. It is full of assertions, assumptions and opinions; it contains no meaningful facts or verifiable sources. What is ""German Technology""? How do we measure advancement? 
Given my objection to the question, I did not research comprable answers.
The answers on H:SE are .. nonresponsive and unsatisfying.</li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/9995/1401"">What is the earliest known account of the modern military
salute?</a>
This question is precise, well referenced and clear. The criteria for judging the answer are clear.  This is probably a model for one type of soution to the ""example"" problem.  Rather than asking for ""example of X"", if we ask for ""Earliest example of X"", I think it better fits the SE model.
The answers are solid, well researched, and well documented. </li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/9972/1401"">Was it common practice in Victorian London or other Western European
cities to name locations as places where fictional characters lived
and acted?</a>
I don't like this question. I think it is too broad ""Victorian London or other Western European cities"", and ""common practice"" make it impossible for me to evaluate answers. I think the question deserves more attention under the rubric of ""list questions"".</li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10022/1401"">Were any drugs (except alcohol) forbidden medevial or ancient times?</a>
This question is too broad and should have been closed - what are the boundaries of ""medieval or ancient times""? What is ""forbidden""?  I rather wish that I had suggested that the question be rephrased to ""What is the earliest example of an anti-drug policy?"" or something along those lines.<br>
Given my misgivings about the question, I cannot evaluate the answer. It is true, but does it really answer the question.</li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10123/1401"">What factors made Europe conquer almost the whole world?</a>
<strong>CLOSE IT CLOSE IT CLOSE IT, please oh please close it</strong>  I feel rather strongly about this one, but I'm in the minority.  This is almost the canonical example of a question that requires a huge book to answer, and is therefore a very bad fit for H:SE.  The question also gives off a pervasive odor of exceptionalism, which would require another book.  Now that I've vented my spleen, I have to admit that the question gave rise to some decent answers. I will yield to the majority on this. </li>

  <p>I will probably make some members these very happy if I resign, thereby allowing them unbridled license to spew inaccurate, biased, poorly researched, superficial answers and win the points popularity contests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question you need to ask yourself is: will you be making <em>yourself</em> happy?</p>

<p>Presumably you signed on here because you <em>did</em> want to participate in the creation of ""some sort of authoritative repository for History"". And unless you were exceedingly naive back then, you must've realized how monumental a task this would be... </p>

<p>The study of history has always been fraught with controversy and bias, even among trained scholars. Would you expect anything different on a website open to the general public and (at this point in time) populated by folks for whom it is primarily a hobby? I don't think you would, and I don't think you <em>did</em> - from what I can see, you're a pretty savvy observer. So you <em>knew</em> what you were getting into...</p>

<p>...But of course, that doesn't make it any less frustrating. </p>

<p>Here's the kicker: we don't know if this idea will pan out. There's a big blue ""<a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/whats-beta"">Beta</a>"" label in the title <em>because</em> we don't know if it'll work. Enthusiasm and hope don't always translate into something good... Sometimes, the problem is too hard, the goals of each individual too much in conflict with one another, and that initial optimism dies along with any hope of making The Internet a better place for finding good information on a topic. If History Stack Exchange falls apart, descending into partisan bickering and irrelevance, then... Well, it'd hardly be the first such community to do so.</p>

<p><strong>But here's why I think it has a chance:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have no time or patience for the childish petulance of some members</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither do I. And I don't even participate on this site. I signed on to Stack Overflow five years ago <em>because</em> I was sick of lazy questions, poorly-researched opinionated answers, and endless bickering... About <em>computer programming.</em> The software here allowed for a few things that weren't possible elsewhere, and with them a chance at producing something other than yet another group of misinformed jackasses:</p>

<ul>
<li>Questions can be edited to clearly state a problem without unnecessary cruft.</li>
<li>Answers are not locked into a fixed chronological order, but can be posted at any time, edited and improved, and elevated based on their <em>usefulness to others</em>. </li>
<li>Threads can be closed <em>and removed</em> if they become opinion-heavy train-wrecks. </li>
<li>Comments are optional, and voting - the means by which useful answers are elevated and misinformed ones are buried - is <strong>strictly anonymous</strong>. </li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/behavior"">Civility is required</a>. If you can't criticize <strong>constructively</strong>, then don't say anything at all; if you're just here to troll for knee-jerk responses or get up on your soapbox, you can go somewhere else.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, as useful as these tools are in overcoming some of the worst tendencies of online (or other...) communities, they're no magic pixie dust: folks can and do misuse them or fail to utilize them at all. It's not hard to find lousy questions and useless answers on Stack Overflow or any other SE site, and sometimes that ends up being all a site can produce... Sometimes, these beta experiments <a href=""http://meta.answers.onstartups.com/questions/1062/answers-onstartups-will-close-on-november-12-2013"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fail</a>. </p>

<p>But <em>this one</em> hasn't yet, and doesn't need to. Maybe it has for you, and that's your call - if you're done trying to make this place something better, then you're better off walking away now; this should <em>never</em> be something you aren't doing out of love for the topic and hope for the creation of a better place for it. But if you do stick around - and for the rest of the folks who <em>are</em> sticking around - I have a few suggestions that might make it a bit less of a painful experience for you...</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Vote! Vote like the outcome of a Chicago election depends on it.</strong> You think you know what a good question or answer looks like? Then make that known: vote up everything good, <em>and down-vote everything bad.</em> What's that? You don't think a lazy, unsourced but nominally-correct answer is worth a down-vote? You're afraid of driving away new members by rating their poorly-asked questions honestly? Then you deserve the crap-fest you get as a result. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Write the best damn answers you can.</strong> You can't control what other people do, but when it comes to writing your own answer you have the final say in what it looks like: use  it. Be your own worst critic, and lead by example: if you're concerned about bias and lack of citations elsewhere, make sure your own answers are factual and clearly drawn from reliable sources. Respond to external criticism by going above and beyond to edit in relevant information and present it in a clear writing style. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leave concise, factual criticism on misleading answers.</strong> But <em>don't</em> get drawn into arguments: say your piece and <em>walk away</em>. If someone can refute your critique, they're free to do so, but <strong>make it clear by your actions</strong> that you won't be drawn into pointless debates. By the same token, don't respond to criticisms on your own posts unless you can refute them with facts and without becoming emotional or defensive. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Don't Feed The Trolls:</a> if you observe a particularly inflammatory or nonconstructive comment (on <em>any</em> post), <strong>flag it</strong> and move on. Ditto for questions or answers that are clearly, irredeemably inflammatory. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Voting is anonymous - keep it that way.</strong> The reputation and scoring systems here are fun, and serve a useful purpose in controlling both the privileges assigned to members and the status of individual posts. That said, <em>they are not the primary focus of this site.</em> If you end up fixating on them - or encouraging others to do so - everyone will suffer for this. So leaving comments like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>-1:</strong> [actual problem goes here]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Downvoting</strong> because... [reasoned critique goes here].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or even this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>+1:</strong> [reason why you think a post is valuable goes here]. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>...is all counter-productive. Instead of leading with the information you most want to communicate, you're starting right off with a distraction - and an implicit invitation for the reader to engage in some tit-for-tat rather than calmly addressing or refuting your criticisms. Even if <em>everything else you write</em> is constructive and well-reasoned, you're subverting this tone right from the start - <em>stop doing that</em>. </p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>To summarize all this:</strong> if you're going to participate here, do your best to work with the system, to use the tools given you, and to set an example for others to follow. It's not easy, and there's no guarantee of success, but very little of value in this world comes easily or without effort; if you think this is important, then work to make it happen.</p>

<p>In closing, I'd like to thank you for raising this topic here. Even if you did so in an unnecessarily dramatic fashion, the fact that you decided to take a matter that's been troubling you before the community here rather than passive-aggressively working it into your communication on the site itself speaks to a level of respect for others that, IMHO, would be nice to see more of. </p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

Looking over this quarter's evaluation, I'd say that things are going rather well on History.SE.  I appreciate <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/798/690"">Mark C. Wallace's analysis</a> of the sample questions and all the input on the <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/636/lets-get-critical-jul-2013-site-self-evaluation"">July sample</a>.  They were very helpful in my evaluation.</p>

<p>Quality, overall, looks good.  Yes, there are some below par questions mixed in, but I see a number of real <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/optimizing-for-pearls-not-sand/"">pearls</a> too.  I love seeing well researched answers that cannot easily be found anywhere else.  Sure there could be improvement, but I'm not much concerned on that front.</p>

<p><a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/5169/history"">Traffic</a> has improved quite a bit since the last evaluation and it's solidly in the green.  A good deal arrives at the site via search engines (Google, mostly), which is an important sign of success.  You all should be proud of your progress toward making the internet a better place to learn about history.</p>

<p>As I see it, this site is on a good trajectory, but there are still things that can be improved given time and some effort.  The easy thing to articulate is that there seem to be about a dozen folks who participate regularly and a 100 or so who participate occasionally.  I suspect that the community would be stronger with more folks providing input on the shape of the site.</p>

<p>Harder to address is my concern that the core of this community are not on the same page when it comes to future direction.  Particularly difficult is how much leeway to give askers of controversial questions (religion, politics, verging on bigotry, and potential conspiracy theories).  For better or worse, History is on the Stack Exchange site circuit for people who ask such questions.     The temptation is to tighten the rules so that you don't have to deal with the fallout of such question.  But there's a lot to be said for Mark C. Wallace's <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/801/690"">suggestion</a> of demanding answerable, civil, and researched questions.</p>

<p>In sum, you all have built a site full of potential that is already helping thousands of visitors a day learn a thing or two about history.  A primary goal should be to invite more people to participate either through personal and professional contacts or by drawing in casual users.  I look forward to seeing this site grow in the months ahead.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Let's examine the cost/benefit of rework.  If SE is intended to serve as a reference source, if we want SE Q&amp;A to float to the top of search engines, and if we want the periodic self assessments to indicate that SE Q&amp;A are better research sources than comparative sources, then we need to edit those questions, sometimes extensively.</p>

<p>@Pietr Geerkens is correct to be concerned about invalidating answers submitted in good faith; if we were a simple Q&amp;A site, I would agree wholeheartedly.  But if we are to serve as a reference source, then we need to edit questions to remove extraneous matter.  Assertions like (loose paraphrase) <em>Western printing is better than Eastern because we know the name of the inventor</em> diminish the value of the question.  Poor English grammar and spelling will diminish the ability of search engines to find, index, and correllate questions.  (For a while my girlfriend made a living by buying things on ebay that were spelled incorrectly and selling them with the spelling corrected.)</p>

<p>Since it is early in the AM, and I haven't yet had my caffiene, let me offer the following explicit disclaimer; Mr. Geerkens' question is interesting and nontrivial, and although I challenge the details of Mr. Thio's question, I am interested in the answer to his question.

<p>I agree that we need to curate out trivia.  Before you ask on H:SE, ask google.  I've said elsewhere that if I enter your question into google and the answer is one of the first five results, I'll probably downvote and probably vote to close. </p>

<p>I think where we disagree is on a specific category of questions - questions where the researcher (answerer) <strong>understands</strong> the question more deeply than OP.  <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/11094/1401"">Sculpture and shield</a> is a good example. Researcher recognized the iconography of saints, posted links to wikipedia.  The answer wouldn't be any better if the answer were an essay on the history of hagiography or a Chicago style book citation of a book found only in a library. </p>

<p>Wikipedia provides answers - not ultimate answers, but quite frankly good enough answers - they're in a very sweet spot of cost/benefit/alternatives analysis.  Wikipedia is not a venial sin, it is merely the first/next stop on the journey that you're pursuing through history. Sometimes Wikipedia is enough to foreclose a red herring, sometimes it provides a whole new cluster of terms &amp; connections to research. </p>

<p>H:SE needs to find the right sweet spot - and in my opinion, that sweet spot is that H:SE provides skilled interpretation.  SE excels at providing the context to permit OP's to leverage existing resources.  H:SE is a little different because we don't have practical problems, but H:SE does provide context &amp; interpretation to permit people to pursue research that they find interesting.  </p>

<p>This question has 4 Upvotes, so presumably people think it is a good question. Before the question was migrated, I removed the references to Paisley, because they didn't seem to be useful for inclusion. Paisley was speaking figuratively, so what <strong>truth</strong> in his claim are we supposed to be verifying? What is unclear to me is if the Reconstruction was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a 15-year policy [...] in which the military was stationed in the South in order to maintain law and order now that the Confederate government was gone, help rebuild the infrastructure after the devastation of the war, and ensure the equal treatment of whites and blacks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How could the south still be <strong>suffering</strong> from a rebuilding effort? If Reconstruction rebuilt the railroads/roads/cities then could present-day southern states be suffering, because those railroads/roads/cites exist? If reconstruction guaranteed southern blacks the right to vote, can the south be suffering from blacks being allowed to vote today? This question seems oddly worded.</p>

<p><strong>Should the Paisley information be removed from the question?</strong> (If not, what does it add to the question?)</p>

<p><strong>Should the question be about the negative effects of Reconstruction, or something else?</strong> (Perhaps a more balanced positive &amp; negative effects of Reconstruction? I can't see how we are supposed to measure the effects of a rebuilding effort on the south (opposed to the normal infrastructure, equal treatment, and crime statistics of the <strong>North</strong>) 150 years later without getting a lot of compounding factors in the measurement, but is that what we are supposed to be measuring?</p>

<p>Second, I edited the question to be clear upfront that the stereotype is demonstrably false.  Polish people are as likely as anyone else to be intelligent or not.  I hope that addresses your specific concern.  (If not, I'd be happy to learn more.)</p>

<p>Third, I wanted to address the broader question of the study of history that you implicitly raised:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What offends is the hidden presumption in the question that <em>the stereotype is rational</em>, rather than an emotional outburst of bigotry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reading between the lines, it seems to me that asking for the <em>reason</em> behind something that happened in history is where the presumption is hidden.  For many topics, that's a fair reading: if I can identify the reasoning for concluding that pi is irrational, it's rational for me to believe that mathematical fact.</p>

<p>But historical reasoning is often different.  Knowing <em>why</em> Lieutenant Henry S. Farley fired upon <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Sumter"" rel=""nofollow"">Fort Sumter</a> does not make that action rational.  History abounds with bad reasoning resulting in monumentally bad ideas.  Asking where such ideas originated does not validate them as ideas.  A considerable portion of the study of history, in fact, boils down to the question: ""What were they thinking?!?""</p>

<p>Finally, we <em>have</em> seen questions that assume or imply racism on.  Fact is, bigotry of all types exists.  The best place to dispute racist assumptions is in an answer.  Next best is a sympathetic edit.  (Sympathetic is key here.  Sometimes people don't know or understand what the problem is.  An edit that allows a question to be asked without offending folks can help an asker save face.)  Third best is raising the question here, in meta.</p>

But the truth is that there are too many questions that are unanswerable (or that should not be answered) because the author is typing them in a stream of conciousness mode without any effort to do preliminary research.  They are a bad fit for this site and they pollute the site.  The requirement to do/show preliminary research leads to a stronger site with higher quality answers.  If you despise wikipedia, then provide other sources.</p>

<p>I believe we could do a better job of assisting users to revise questions. I believe we also need to accept that having a question put on hold for revision/reedit/reopen is perfectly legitimate.  Finally, I believe that downvotes are merely expressions of opinion.</p>

<p>If you feel that a reference to wikipedia, invalidates the site, then by all means, follow where that leads you.  If, on the other hand, you're interested in history, interested in learning, and interested in understanding our past and how we got here, then please reconsider and assist us in developing a higher quality site.</p>

<p>We discuss historiography on H:SE, and the site is richer for that discussion. Google can provide trivial facts and dates; a true understanding of history requies an understanding of the ""changing interpretation of those events"".</p>

  <p>Furay and Salevouris (1988) define historiography as ""the study of the way history has been and is written – the history of historical writing...

<li><p>Inclusion of Historiography questions will help us to self consistently and self-referentially demonstrate the scope/culture/ of this site. Some (possibly many) of the questions we must reject are rejected for reasons that they ignore assumptions and traditions of historiography.   </p></li>

<p>I must respectfully disagree with Mr. Geerkens; although it is possible to treat historiography as a discursive drinking game, I belive it can also provide objective answers. For example, the analysis of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation_of_constantine"" rel=""nofollow"">Donation of Constantine</a>. Historiography can also be used to discuss questions where there is no provable answer, but where all participants agree (e.g. there is no formal, legal definition of ""hot"", but if we all agree that it is hot, then it is safe to proceed on the assumption that it is hot.).</p>

<p><em>Needs Improvement</em>. I like this question a lot. However, a request for a slightly better rewording in the comments went unanswered. Also, I pretty much had to enter the entire title before Google found it (top hit when it did though). But the worst problem is that none of the answers were ever accepted. The best answer of the bunch IMHO was really too short. Given the user's rep, its unclear they are around enough to even accept a good answer if it appears.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/11000/oldest-appearance-of-brand-names-in-history"">Oldest appearance of &quot;brand names&quot; in history?</a></p>

<p><em>Satisfactory</em>. Its worded a bit too much like we are playing a trivia game, but otherwise a very good question. It has a good accepted answer, although one which is worded a bit too tentatively for my taste. Its main problem is that I had to add the word ""appearance"" to get it to show up on a Google search.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10969/when-the-term-president-was-used-the-first-time"">When the term &quot;president&quot; was used the first time?</a></p>

<p><em>Needs Improvement</em>. An interesting question, with a very good answer. However, there is only the one answer, it has not been accepted, and I couldn't find it on Google <em>even when I search on the exact question title</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10793/how-did-the-dutch-east-india-company-voc-have-so-much-revenue-when-they-only-c"">How did the Dutch East India Company (VOC) have so much revenue when they only control small part of Indonesia?</a></p>

<p><em>Satisfactory (barely)</em>. Somehow I missed this one when it was asked. The question itself could use a little cleaning up. As it is, it seems to be asking ""How do people make money out of trade routes?"", but could probably be tweaked to be more specific to the VOC. It has three pretty good answers, but again none have been accepted. It shows up fifth in the dumbest Google query I could think of on the subject, a pretty darn good performance.</p>

<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10913/to-what-extent-did-the-cpc-avoid-fighting-with-the-japanese"">To what extent did the CPC avoid fighting with the Japanese?</a></p>

<p><em>Needs Improvement</em>. I could see a tweak or two to the wording, but for the most part the question is great. Best of the bunch by far. It also is the <em>top</em> hit for the first Google search I tried. However, the only answer at present is negatively voted. It looks to be an eminently answerable question, so there is really no excuse for this.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10903/prominent-examples-of-scientific-racism-in-ancient-greece"">Prominent examples of scientific racism in ancient Greece</a></p>

<p><em>Needs Improvement</em>. IMHO the question is too long, with way too much quoted material. Other than that complaint, it is a great concept for a question, and very well written. It is also top hit on my Google search. It has a fairly good answer (lots of upvotes). That's where the good news ends though. There was only the one answer, it is probably too emotionally worded, and for whatever reason the OQ didn't find it acceptable. I'm giving it the NI purely on the lack of an accepted answer. There's a very fine line between this question being excellent instead, but it presently falls over onto the bad side.</p>

<p><em>Needs Improvement</em> - Judging by my past votes, I personally like this question and its top to answers. However, judging by the other votes they all received, that doesn't appear to have been a common opinion. It was about the 9th hit on merely ""ruffs fashion"", which I consider pretty darn good. Again, none of the answers have been accepted. Again, I'd have changed my vote to ""Excellent"" if not for that fact.</p>

<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/11010/what-factors-led-to-the-30-devaluation-of-pound-sterling-in-1949"">What factors led to the 30% devaluation of pound sterling in 1949?</a></p>

<p><em>Needs Improvement</em> - Another one I missed while out of town. I like this question, although it is of a dangerous variety, in that it tempts speculative answers that don't rely on consensus historical opinion. The top answer IMHO succumbed to the temptation. The next answer is much better. The question showed up 5th on a simple Google search, which is really pretty good. However, again no accepted answer.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10961/did-the-civil-wars-of-17th-century-england-facilitate-an-independent-spirit-in-t"">Did the civil wars of 17th century England facilitate an independent spirit in the American colonies?</a></p>

<p><em>Needs Improvement</em> - A very well-worded question, although one that is sadly a bit squishy. The sole answer avoided this sandtrap by instead devoting itself to describing the buildup to the American Revolutionary War, as if a question about that was asked instead. It was (probably rightly) not accepted.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10835/what-is-the-significance-of-roof-charms-outside-of-the-forbidden-city"">What is the significance of roof charms outside of the Forbidden City?</a></p>

<p><em>Excellent</em> - A great question. Just the kind of thing SO sites are needed for. I remember researching this myself, and there really was no straightforward answer to be found on the internet (I know I commented otherwise at the time, but that info really had to be coaxed out). The accepted answer could use some tweaking, but is pretty good. Google found it on the 4th hit. Biggest issue is that there's only the one answer.</p>

<hr>

<p>Final analysis: The Achilles' heel for the stack here in my evaluation seems to be <strong>questions with no acceptance</strong>.  I'm kind of hard on this one, because I know when I'm searching and hit other SE sites, I don't find questions without accepted answers very helpful (although sometimes an extreme amount of upvotes will do instead). </p>

<p>In some cases the lack of an accepted answer may simply be due to the questioners not hanging around to maintain their question, but at least a couple of cases appear to be due to no ""acceptable"" answer being posted.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10903/1401"">Prominent examples of scientific racism in ancient Greece</a>
The first page of google results overlap with the material presented in the question; consequently I judge that the answers are superior to anything that google provides. I have only a superficial acquaintance with the historiography of racism, but I’m not aware of any source that surpasses this.  Underlying this is the point that Mr. Geerkens makes in his answer; that the underlying theory is of questionable value.  I think the question is reasonably well formed, well researched and documented, but I think that the OP and the scholar in question have reached conclusions that are not fully supported by the source material.  Mr. Geerkens’ answer serves as a useful (albeit strong)  debunking. Overall rating: <em>satisfactory</em></li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10810/1401"">How did ruffs become fashionable and then went out of fashion?</a>
The first page of google reveals multiple sources that discuss the topic of the question, and provide theories to answer the question. 

<ul>
<li>Repository of Arts, Literature, Fashions &amp;c By Rudolph Ackermann, Frederic Shober</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/European-Culture-16th-Century/Ruffs.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fashion Encyclopedia</a><br>
The SE answers are inferior to the google answers.  The question doesn’t demonstrate any research. Neither answer really addresses the core question; both are supported with some research. I must mark this one “needs improvement”. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10969/1401"">When the term “president” was used the first time?</a>
Clearly the OP did not do preliminary research; wikipedia offers an answer.  That answer is however, wrong, as the SE answer predates the wikipedia answer by several centuries. Bad question, good answer.  SE gets marked superior.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10961/1401"">Did the civil wars of 17th century England facilitate an independent spirit in the American colonies?</a>
I believe this is a bad question - it reads like an essay question on a middle grade history exam. It is intrinsically opinion based.  There is no evidence of preliminary research, although I must admit that OP must have done some reading in order to conclude that “it seems like England was endless dealing with battles…”.<br>
The entire first page of google is filled with references to SE; there doesn’t seem to be a useful answer in the first two pages of google.  One of the reasons that I suspect this of being a homework question is that this mirrors the kind of oversimplification that was presented to me in middle school; there is undoubtedly truth in the thesis, but demonstrating that thesis requires scholarship and a page count far above SE expectations.  I’m going to reluctantly mark SE superior to the internet on this, entirely due to the efforts of Tom Au to portray complex trends in a few paragraphs.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10835/1401"">What is the significance of roof charms outside of the Forbidden City?</a>
Excellent question, because it is somewhat difficult to research without background.  Google reveals a whole bunch of answers that mention the roof charms, but do not explain them. SE answer disclaims strong authority, but provides an introduction. I would have preferred a little more depth.  I’m going to mark this satisfactory. </p></li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10793/1401"">How did the Dutch East India Company (VOC) have so much revenue when they only control small part of Indonesia?</a>
I’m of two minds about this one; I’m in the middle of listening to “A splendid exchange” by Bernstein. Bernstein provides a clear explanation that would answer the question which is far superior to either of the answers presented. OP asks why VOC was able to make a higher profit than the locals; the simple answer is that the VOC had more capital, and had access to markets where the goods were exponentially more valuable. 
OP asks the question based on reading wikipedia; I infer that OP lacks some of the context/scholarship to understand international trade flows in a partially connected world. Revenue is not proportional to the fraction of Indonesia that the company controls, it is proportional to access to markets and to capital. 
Comparing the SE answers to google, SE is superior, but only because google is utterly inadequate.  The first page of results contains essential the source that OP cites (and if it were sufficient, OP wouldn’t have needed to ask the question) and a bunch of irrelevant material. 
I’m going to have to reluctantly mark this as satisfactory; I want to mark the question “Needs Improvement” because it does, but I have to admit that the answers are superior to google.</li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/11000/1401v"">Oldest appearance of “brand names” in history?</a>
I don’t like the question; the terms are ill defined. Google provides clear answers for first brand and first trademark, but OP seems to be using the term idiosyncratically.  The fact that I don’t like the question isn’t really relevant; OP managed to communicate the idiosyncratic use successfully and SE provided an acceptable answer.  This is a distinctive value of SE because google is useless to answer a question where the answer depends on interpretation of an idiosyncratic interpretation.  I’ll reluctantly mark this superior.</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10898/1401"">Population disparities between New York City and Boston</a>
This is a flawed question; OP assumes that the importance of a city has something to do with relative population growth. OP provides no research to support that assumption. I also don't like questions where the title is not a question, but that's just unfair of me.
Google is not terribly useful; if I were compelled, google does provide tools to restrict searches in time, and I could assemble an answer based on those tools, but it would be time consuming and error prone. 
SE is clearly superior; Pietr Geerkens deserves the plaudits if only for the phrase “the least biased … I could find”.  Because the question is flawed, Mr. Geerkens doesn’t answer it as much as recontextualize the problem. This may be another SE distinctive value.  Again I’m going to reluctantly mark this one as superior, because SE has provided value that the internet can’t.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/10913/1401"">To what extent did the CPC avoid fighting with the Japanese?</a>
I hate questions which include acronyms I have to research before I can understand the question. I ignored this question because I didn’t want to research “what is the CPC” and “What era in history” before I could get into the troublesome problem of inferring the motivation of the parties involved.  Wikipedia says that the CPC did fight a guerilla war against the Japanese. Wikipedia on the Dixie Missions explains why the CPC didn’t fight the Japanese.  That said, OP did cover that research in his question, so I have to shut up and eat crow. I can’t or won’t complain about a question that does preliminary research. 
SE provides no useful answer to the question. the single answer is downvoted; I’m not expert enough in the subject area to judge why.
I’ll have to mark this “needs improvement”.</p></li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/11010/1401"">What factors led to the 30% devaluation of pound sterling in 1949?</a>
I’m going to recuse myself from comment on this, since I provided an answer. I will admit that I’m voting this “needs improvement” because there are more parts of the story that are not in the SE answer. </li>
</ol>

<p>So what's my conclusion?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I didn't complain about civility once. That makes me happy. Some of the Q&amp;A were worded strongly, but none of them made my skin crawl. This is a very good thing and makes me happy.</p></li>
<li><p>SE is superior when the questions are bad.  I want all questions to be perfect, but as someone pointed out in meta, perfect questions are very hard.  When the OP lacks context or has erroneous assumptions, SE provides value that other resources can't.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite my whingeing about the questions, I think they're better than the last crop we evaluated.  Last time I ranted about questions that should have been closed with extreme predjudice. This time there are a couple of questions that I don't like, but only in the ""horses for courses"" sense.</p></li>
<li><p>The only two questions that I rated ""needs improvement"" probably rely on fairly specialized disciplines of history (fashion history and economic history). I think I can live with that. </p></li>

<p>Parting Ways, Testing Waters: Norway’s Early Olympic Ventures  By John F. L. Ross</p>
<p>Fidelity to fair play informs a Norwegian national passion for OL, the Olympic Games, that embraces popular engagement, organizational skill and athletic prowess. Yet dominance in ice-and-snow sport has siphoned attention from Norway’s initial Olympic engagements that, up to 1924, were summer-only. These reflected an uneasy push-pull dynamic shaped by internal politics, socio-cultural traditions and regional tensions. The nascent Olympic stage gave Norway, which split acrimoniously from Sweden in 1905, needed visibility in an age of ascendant nationalism. However, the elitist early-modern Olympic world also clashed with egalitarian impulses and indigenous traditions that revered idræt, the vigorous but non-competitive pursuit of athletic endeavor. A wider values conflict was telescoped into the Norwegian debate during formative decades, while tensions with Sweden formed a little-known political backdrop to the 1912 Stockholm games. Only from the 1930s could Norway make peace with the Olympic project and forge its Hegelian-like postwar synthesis in which sporting professionalism has eclipsed yet not eradicated traditional idræt  elements.</p>

<p>This indicates that sports history is like any topically focused area of historiography.  We are unlikely to be able to answer details of historical trivia regarding sport.  We are highly likely to be able to answer contextualised issues around sports, gender, society, politics, nation, class, emotionality, &quot;the person,&quot; the history of ideas.</p>
<p>The question ported to the sports site seemed to be a matter of trivia, and close to a list request, rather than a historically contextualised question.</p>

<p>We are aware this is a tougher topic than most to ask interesting and unique questions about.  This factors into our graduation decision.</p>

<p>Of the <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/sites#questionsperday"">115 sites</a>, History.SE is currently ranked at 72 by questions per day.  It's ranked 74 <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/sites#users"">by number of users</a> and 67 <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/sites#traffic"">by traffic</a>.  So it's right around where we'd expect it to be by the numbers.  The recent <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/857/lets-get-critical-jan-2014-site-self-evaluation"">self-evaluation</a> (and my analysis of it) suggest that question about history <em>are</em> harder to ask than questions on other topics.  Even so, questions do seem to get good traction on Google (~87% of traffic comes from search engines) and the quality of answers is generally higher other resources on the internet.</p>

<h2>Long Version</h2>

<p>There are two ways to look at the data.  Either:</p>

<ol>
<li>The number of users and traffic drive question rates, or</li>
<li>The number of questions per day drives traffic and user participation.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first is the most obvious mechanism since you can't have questions without people to ask them.  So let's jump straight to the second:</p>

<p>Suppose you are a brand new user to History.SE.  Maybe you came from another Stack Exchange site or maybe you found an answer to a question here when using a search engine.  If the site looks good to you on first contact, you might start looking around.  The obvious first place to start is the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/"">active questions page</a> (which is where you go when you click ""History beta"" on the upper left of the page). Hopefully there are some interesting questions to read (such as <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10933/has-there-ever-been-a-truly-multi-sided-war"">Has there ever been a truly multi-sided war?</a>, which was recently highlighted by the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/stackexchange"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stack Exchange Facebook account</a>).</p>

<p>Ideally, a new user will find a few questions that are interesting and maybe be inspired to ask or answer one themselves.  But it's probably more realistic to assume they will be distracted by a cat video someone posted somewhere else.  If they ever come back, it would be helpful to see some fresh content.  New answers on old questions can be helpful there, but the best thing would be a fresh question that the new user is interested in and might answer.</p>

<p>You can make a very similar argument for traffic with the big difference that it's Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc. who come back to visit the site.  Search engines like fresh content since it's a sign the information is being curated.  New pages (which is what a question represents to the rest of the internet) opens up new search keywords that help people discover the site.  So the rate that new questions are asked correlates with the rate that search engines drive traffic our way.</p>

<p>Therefore the very best thing you can do for this site is to find an expert in history who needs an outlet for their writing.  But the <em>next best</em> thing you can do is <strong>ask a great question</strong> every now and then.  In many areas of life the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_Dreams#Plot"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Field of Dreams</a> approach just won't work.  People won't miraculously show up at your cornfield just because you built a ballpark there.  But it can work on Stack Exchange.  If several people decide to ask a question or two a week, you could probably raise the questions per day a noticeable amount.  It might be a temporary effect, but you might catch the next great contributor on History.SE.</p>

<p>15 questions a day, by the way, isn't a scientifically determined number.  Our current gut instinct (based on <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/sites#questionsperday"">existing sites</a>) is closer to 10 per day.  <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/"">Skeptics</a>, which has the most restictions on participation, gets by with about 4 a day.  One of the projects I'm currently working on is figuring out how much extra participation asking questions produces.  I hope that among my findings will be more refined estimates of what question rate signals a healthy site.</p>

<ol>
<li>I'm not sure what ""condemn"" means, </li>
<li>I'm not sure what ""officially"" means, and </li>
<li>I'm not sure what the precendent is that would cause us to condemn one action of the US government separate from all the other actions that turned out in retrospect to be unpopular.</li>
</ol>

<p>Although superficially the question is objective, answerable, and historical, my doubts about the meaning of the words lead me to doubt that the answer would be meaningful.  I believed that this question would be a better fit for a site which encouraged a more discursive response.  I believe that the answer to this question would mislead as many as it enlightened, infurate as many as it clarified, and insult as many as it educated.  I feel obliged to acknowledge that I did not know that the Supreme Soviet had condemned the Soviet involvement in their Afghan actions.  I'm not sure that that would have changed my ""close"" vote, but honestly compells me to admit that the fact should be taken into account.  If the question is re-opened, I suggest that this fact (appropriately cited) be documented.</p>

Yes, it's expanded way, way beyond that, but you have to consider its origins. Personally, I'm a software dev and I got into this site specifically because there's a subsite that deals with my specialty (SharePoint, if you care). Anyway... most people who work in software development have a BS in their field, which required them to take lots of science courses, so one can understand why the sciences are so popular. Additionally, there is a lot of bleedover between software development and fields like mathematics (graphics-based stuff like games in particular can get really, really mathy) and physics, and a lot of scientists have to dabble in programming in order to create the tools they need to run experiments effectively.</p>

<p>Then there is the relative popularity of forums like rpg.stackexchange and the science fiction section. Not to get too stereotypical but hey, I'm kind of a nerd myself and I am definitely into at least one and at times two of those things. It's not that surprising, I don't think, to see that a site devoted primarily to software development and IT related issues is going to also have a lot of people into RPGs and the like.</p>

<p>History, though, is on down the list. This isn't to say that nobody's interested in history, but the cohort that comes to SE to figure out how to add a stack panel on a SharePoint site isn't necessarily going to be heavily into history. I mean, I am, because everyone's different (and in fairness my background is about as weird for a programmer as it gets, I think), but I certainly don't think you can <em>expect</em> the same level of enthusiasm for this area.</p>

<p>Over the year or so that I have been using this SE the majority of the reference request type questions have been of poor quality.

<p>Yes, they are reference requests and that is out of the scope of this SE. However, when the question is well written and well reasoned I feel that it could be in scope, and is a valid and useful question for someone to ask. </p>

<p>I think that reference requests could possibly be effectively policed using the existing ""low quality"", ""opinion based"" and ""Off-Topic"" close reasons.</p>

The first <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/7577/how-far-should-i-go-back-in-russian-history-in-order-to-understand-communist-rus"">question</a> was closed as it is obviously off topic as currently phrased (as explained in comments by Mark C. Wallace). The question is flawed in a couple of ways. It's of limited use to other people, it's too broad (as there isn't a single book that would answer the question) and it's poorly formatted.</p>

<p>On the other side, the question regarding <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/1633/good-online-sources-for-historical-maps"">historical maps</a> is a question for which answers will be valid of a wider range of people. As stated in a comment on that question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While technically off topic, the answers to this question provide a valuable resource that is not readily available elsewhere on the web, accomplishing an explicitly defined goal of the site: to improve that corner of the web dealing with matters of historical interest. I suggest leaving it open, but converting all the answers to community wiki.</p>

<p>With this in mind, we could allow reference request questions that are of a high quality (as all our questions would ideally be), provide a valuable resource and are well defined and well targeted (E.g. Books that briefly explain the background to communism in Russia = poorly targeted, broad subject / Online sources for medieval maps = well targeted, well defined subject matter) and use existing close criteria to manage them.</p>

This comment led to a lengthy discussion about it, meanwhile partly erased by (I presume*) a moderador.</p>

<p>I would like to discuss this case here as I believe it is very related with a thread about <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/813/please-dont-push-controversy-in-comments"">controversy of comments</a>.</p>

<p>I have to be honest, I have absolutely no problem that the question can be considered silly by some people.</p>

<p>However, I have a problem that</p>

<ul>
<li>(A) this comment should not belong to this website</li>
<li>(B) a moderador, which in some form represents <strong>us</strong>, erased the discussion but not the comment, neglecting (A).</li>
</ul>

<p>Arguments leading to (A)</p>

<ol>
<li>The comments are intended to be constructive and not offensive.</li>
<li>That comment is not constructive by any definition of ""silly""</li>
<li>That comment can be interpreted offensive by some, by the definition of ""silly"" interpreted as ""absurd and foolish.""</li>
</ol>

<p>At most, this comment should not have been made and instead a downvote should have been casted, even though the author of the comment misunderstood the question in the first place. </p>

<p>Furthermore, he ended up arguing, during the discussion meanwhile erase, that <em>everyone has right to his opinion</em>, which I believe it does not imply that <em>everyone has the right to express it in this website</em>. I mean, are comments meant to express personal opinions on subjects of history.stackexchange?</p>

<p>Arguments leading to (B)</p>

<ol>
<li>The comment lead to a lengthy discussion about it.</li>
<li>A moderador read the discussion and erased what he/she considered irrelevant, keeping the comment.</li>

</ol>

<p>In light of <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/813/please-dont-push-controversy-in-comments"">this question</a>, I open this thread to ask whether <strong>we</strong> should or not decide to erase the discussion without taking into account that the problem may not be on the discussion itself, but also on the comment that gave rise to it, as demonstrated in this case by a new comment from a person that did not participated in the erased discussion.</p>

<p>I don't know how to do this, but I would really like to notify the author of the comment that also participated in the discussion, <code>Drux</code>, and the moderator, which I don't know who he is, about this thread. It only makes sense to discuss this with these persons here.</p>

Moderating comments properly is really a deceptively involved and time-consuming process, and one in which all the SE tools and constraints of Real Life are encouraging moderators to take shortcuts. </p>

<p>I don't believe I did anything on that question personally. But I know that when I log in and decide to take care of flags, and see a flagged comment, the temptation is to just delete the danged thing right there and move on.</p>

<p>Generally, its better to go read the comment in context (which means reading the question, the post the comment is attached to, and all the other comments). The next temptation is to just delete the thing there, and go on my merry way. However, if you do that often the ensuing comments become senseless. Also, sometimes (particularly if the problem is that post changes have made it obsolete), there's prior comments, or even portions of prior comments, that need to be removed as well. Occasionally it gets so complex that I don't think straightening it out is worth <em>anyone's</em> time, and I'll just ""declare comment bankruptcy"" and purge them all. </p>

<p>Analyzing all this properly frankly a lot of the time ends up requiring a greater time investment that I really have available when I was just popping in to see if there was any quick maintenance needed. Again, that adds to the temptation to just delete the flagged comment and move on. Personally, I try to leave thorny flags for later (or someone else with more time) if I don't have enough time to properly analyze them, but I can easily see where someone else (or even me on a bad day) might occasionally end up cutting corners.</p>

<p>And then there's always the possibility that the user who posted the comment deletes it. In fact, if the reason for the comment gets addressed (or you just think better of saying such a thing), that's highly encouraged.</p>

<p>As a user (aka: victim), I think the takeaway should be that comments, unlike proper posts, are not meant to have any permanence. They are writing in the sand. They could stay up for years, or they could be purged tomorrow. If you have something important to say on the subject at hand, you probably ought to try to make a proper post out of it.</p>

The question referred to in this post was edited and the problem was fixed this morning. It is still closed at this time and still attracted down voters. Please do consider re-opening the poor users question.</p>

<p>I've never used meta, so please bear with me and I'm not here to criticize anyone. There has been a recent major uptick in the past two weeks I find concerning, since I'm worried it will discourage new users. I went and viewed older posts and the average vote rating for a post has been declining rapidly since about June or July of 2013. I understand you have been trying to improve the post quality and that is an important concern, but I just wanted to express that I really don't think we should be expecting absolute perfection, especially since the rules of Stack Exchange are a bit complex. </p>

<p>For example, this is most recently posted question
<a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/12350/how-did-swiss-neutrality-affect-ww2"">How did Swiss neutrality affect WW2?</a></p>

<p>""Was the neutrality of Switzerland during World War 2 a help or hindrance to Hitler?</p>

<p>Obviously if Switzerland had come out on the side of the Axis powers then that would have been beneficial to Hitler. However, if it had entered the war on the side of the Allies, would that have prolonged or shortened WW2 ? Or not made much difference?""</p>

<p>The main question is I think a very interesting history question and great fit for the site. I welcomed this user, upvoted them, told them we couldn't answer the other portion regarding if Switzerland had entered the war, and referred him to the help center. I thought it was good first question that was workable. This question is on its way to a -2/3 downvote and closed by tomorrow, even with my upvote, because its been happening over and over again lately. Is the opinion that I shouldn't bother with this? I'm a little confused.</p>

<p>Also as much as I understand down voting rules, there isn't a reason to down vote this question, correct? It is clear and not ugly, it may just be considered off-topic and be closed. By sticking to the rules, the downvoting would probably go down. Two, I've noticed there is a tendency to close questions because we don't know the answer to the question. If we close it then no one else can answer either. It's really hard to decide if you don't know something because you don't know it or it isn't something that is known in general, but I think we can be more mindful.  </p>

The ideal is that ""good"" questions (where ""good"" means ""the sort of questions we want to see more of"") will be upvoted, and ""bad"" questions (using the opposite definition) are downvoted.</p>

<p>By that philosophy, it doesn't matter if some people downvote because of a banal idea, some because of bad grammar and some because it's off topic. The mechanism was designed to let the community's voting determine what is acceptable and what isn't, not to flag specific faults in  a question.</p>

<p>I gather from your question that you think that taking rough first-time questions and helping them polish and improve their question's style and focus is a worthwhile goal. Personally, I agree with you. But it's not a universal goal of the site. Some might prefer to simply upvote already-good answers. That's fine too.</p>

<p>Regarding the issues of closing, I don't know what's happening in practice, but the idea of closing questions isn't that there's no known answer, but that leaving them open will invite the sort of answers that the site doesn't want - subjective opinions that will not match the site's vision. Closing questions early is a way to prevent bad answers from popping up.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, the down voting isn't designed as a way of improving a question but of trying to ensure that the best content floats to the top while the not so good content sinking to the bottom. I do agree with you though that it can sometimes be helpful if a comment is left explaining the down vote, where appropriate. </p>

<p>I also agree that the example you gave was a fundamentally good question. It was reasonably unclear in its intention and as originally worded the second paragraph seemed to be asking for speculation rather than fact. Which is why I personally voted to close. I chose not to down vote it because I thought the intent of the question was fine, just that it needed to be re-worded to fit properly. Fortunately, someone had already left a comment to that effect, which saved me the effort.</p>

<p>is something I have noticed recently as well. Unfortunately, I can't find any examples of this at the moment, but I have noticed that in the last couple of months a series of seemingly unanswerable questions have been closed and subsequently deleted. In my book this is a fairly serious problem that we should address. </p>

<p>While I broadly agree with what was said by Anver Shahar-Kashtan on the subject, it's my view that closing a question because it might attract the wrong type of answer seems to be taking a bit to far. The voting system we have in place will highlight the bad answers as bad answers for all to see and understand. The truly terrible answers will be flagged and deleted where appropriate and we might, if we are lucky, get a good answer for the question from someone who does know of an answer.</p>

<li><p>History is unusual for H:SE; a large part of history <strong>is</strong> the examination of sources.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Arguments to treat references as out of scope</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>References are not answers to questions. An answer to a question should be evaluated and judged based on the answer.  If I ask ""What are good references for X"" and someone replies that ""Sujarkama's Economics"" is a good source, then everyone should be able to evaluate whether that answer is good or bad.  I should not have to read  <em>Sujarkama's Economics</em> and discover that it relies on the assumption that one of God's holy laws is that all currency should be in the form of comestibles.   (Knowing that, I'll downvote the answer).</p></li>
<li><p>Eliminating references constrains questions to those that are accessible to all.  Take as an example the original question about IKEA.  I would argue that the edited question is superior because the resulting answer <em>should</em> include both a discussion of the history of IKEA design and <strong>reference</strong> sources where we can learn more.  Good Questions get Good Answers. (I have to admit that I edited the question, so I may have some bias in determining that the resulting question is superior.)</p></li>

<h1>Is there precedent? Have we decided this before?</h1>

<p>I believe that we've discussed this before, but I didn't find a question that really encapsulated the issue that I believe @lohoris and I were discussing. (At this point let me eat some crow - I may have been party to a discussion on another SE site about requests for references which resulted in a strong consensus that they are out of scope.  I have been working from the belief that we had collectively discussed and decided this. So if I could have the crow stir fried with a bit of curry?)</p>

""Ancient Iran"" would best denote the time period before Cyrus the Great to keep it simple. Iranian peoples has a specific set of shared characteristics, as do Persians, though. There is great overlap, but they are the not same. The differences are not just ""political."" They are of serious historical interest, but this might be unimportant to the average visitor here. I'm not sure. IMO I'm never able to put enough detail in short answers for this type of thing to matter. 
For example, sayeth Wiki: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Iranians comprise the present day Persians, Lurs, Ossetians, Kurds, Tajiks, Balochs and their sub-groups of the Medes, Massagetaes, Persians, Sarmatians, Scythians, Parthians, Alans, Bactrians, Soghdians and other people of Central Asia and Iranian plateau. Another possible group are the Cimmerians who are mostly supposed to have been related to either Iranian or Thracian speaking groups, or at least to have been ruled by an Iranian elite. </p>

<p>It is my opinion that <strong>answers 1, 2 and 5</strong> are wholly fabricated and without any supporting evidence what-so-ever. I believe that all rep you earned from those answers was obtained improperly, basically through deception. However, it is possible that I am wrong. If you had actually presented supporting evidence in the way of sources, then I could read, and assess, those sources with the possibility of learning something new, and correcting my opinion. </p>

<p>Alternately, as is appropriate for some questions, if you had argued from first principles a particular point of view, then one could assess your argument and make a judgement on validity. Your axioms and assumptions could be assessed in terms of how suitable they were for the point being made. Again a sound and knowledgeable assessment could be made of your answer.</p>

<p>However, you spout unsupported and occasionally ridiculous facts, and suborn votes from innocent readers of the site. Shame on you! You thus leave regulars no choice but to wish more of their colleagues would harass you for sources, and not just Mark Wallace. (Thank you Mark - I'm glad it is not just me.)</p>

Even if the asker is satisfied without them, it's a really good idea to list sources for those who want to dig further into the topic later.</p>

<p>If you don't give sources, your answer might be perfectly correct, but it is difficult for others to judge its validity for themselves, and, honestly, it's just ""something some guy on the Internet said."" Truth is stranger than fiction, and sometimes some very true things sound unbelievable. No wonder people want sources for them!</p>

<p>Now, your unsourced answer might still help someone out or give them an idea where to look further, but higher quality answers, it seems, contain sources. Because as a reader of the site or a question-asker, I would want to see them.</p>

<p>Tyler said: ""The information page for this Stack Exchange site says that sources are not required, and moreover that questions are not supposed to ask for sources.""</p>

<p>I'm still newish here, but this seems like a misunderstanding to me. I can't find anything on the about page that says whether sources are required. The page does say that questions ""asking for references"" are discouraged because of a tendency to lead to discussion rather than concrete answers. I do not interpret that as ""we should not ask answerers to provide sources."" I interpret it as ""don't post questions like 'what's a good book about WWII'"" or something like that -- it's likely to lead to a lot of opinion and discussion rather than good answers.</p>

<p>However, even then I think it could sometimes be appropriate to ask for reference material here, if the question is narrowly focused and the answer isn't necessarily obvious from basic research. Something like ""I'm having difficulty finding sources for the assertion that [something]; I've tried searching [somewhere] but all I find are people saying they heard it from someone else. Does anyone know of a source that is at least secondary if not actually primary?"" That seems to be a legitimate question here to me -- it's more concrete and useful.</p>

I haven't been entirely comfortable with the conflict in the comment stream, but I haven't been sure how to address the underlying issues. Your question in meta helped me to clarify those issues and my vision for what I want SE to be.</p>
<h1>Are sources required?</h1>
<p>I think your summary is absolutely spot on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is about the philosophy of the site, whether we are going to make it clear that sources are not required. . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You assert, &quot;. . . information page for this Stack Exchange site says that sources are not required . .  &quot;. I'm not sure which information page you are looking at; with my tongue in my cheek, I'll point out that it would have been easier to respond to that if you had provided a source.  My best guess is that you're referencing &quot;<a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer"">Links to external resources are encouraged. . . &quot;</a>. That is somewhat less conclusive than the way you phrase the admonition, and it appears to be a stock/default phrase on the corresponding page of many help centers.</p>
<p>I don't think sources are required; I'd be a hypocrite if I believed that, since several of my answers are unsourced.  I think sources improve almost any answer. I think sources are vital, possibly even critical when addressing contentious topics.  Sources and methods are and essential distinction between history.stackexchange.com and politics.stackexchange.com, or discussion.stackexchange.com.</p>
<p>One of the things that makes history history - is that when we hit a disagreement, we analyze sources to see how strongly they support our arguments. If we don't reference sources, then my opinion is just as good as yours, and we're merely discussing things.  I'm not interested in trading opinions. I think there is ample evidence in the help center that H:SE is intended to be a Q&amp;A site, not a discussion site. There is no way to assess the quality of an opinion.  There are common methods to assess the quality of research and analysis.</p>
<p>At the core, I think this disagreement originates in the first comment that I saw from you - you said something along the lines that one must deploy logic first, and then seek out evidence; I replied that I thought the obligation was to employ research first, and then test the research against logic. That fundamental disagreement is echoed in your comment to
@litlnemo above &quot;What people need to do is THINK...&quot;  I think there are contexts in which your approach is appropriate.  I am afraid that I don't think that it is appropriate for H:SE.</p>
<p>You cite Soviet history books as an example of invalid answers - I completely agree with you.  That is precisely why I want to know the sources that inform your answers; I need to be able to critically examine them.  @Anixx has cited Soviet documents to support his answers.  I believe @Anixx has a first rate mind and is a better researcher than I am, but <strong>when he cites Soviet sources</strong> he applies a different critical frame than I do. I apply a different standard of scrutiny to answers that cite Soviet sources than I do when he cites other sources. The fact that he cites his sources enables me to evaluate the answer.  You don't give me that opportunity - because you don't cite any sources and are hostile to the notion, I have to evaluate all of your answers against a very skeptical standard.</p>
<p>I've read enough of your answers to know that they are thorough.  The problem is that without sources, I can't tell whether they are trustworthy, accurate or reliable.</p>
<h1>Self appointed police</h1>
<p>Guilty as charged.  As the SE about page states, &quot;<a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/tour"">It's built and run by you . . .</a>&quot;  We collectively curate this site.  We vote up and down, we comment, we review.  We discuss our shared vision of what the site should be.  I believe that answers with sources are better. I believe that when an answer touches on contentious topics, sources are essential.  When claims are astonishing, sources are essential. If we collectively decide that sources are not required, then I'll back off.  (I think the current guidance is probably good, although if someone were to suggest some language that we could insert specifically on the H:SE page, that encouraged sources, I'd support that)</p>
<p>Here is the crucial point - if the community tells me to shut up and stop demanding sources, I will.  The community has taken me to task in the past, and I have changed my behavior.</p>

<p>I've split this out into a separate answer. The first answer deals with the issues where I think that there is a useful discussion. I think it is entirely possible that the community will agree with you that my emphasis on sources is overwhelming and should be curbed. I'll be content with that.</p>

<p>There is a second issue where I think there is less ground for compromise. Your second paragraph accuses me of a witchhunt, and borders on ad hominem.  That is not my intent.  I admit that I would have liked to find a more civil way to respond to some of your comments.  Your comments to Mr. Geerkens, cross the line into ad hominem.  @American Luke cited the admonition that we must always be respectful.  </p>

1. A short justification for why the filter term would improve the site
1. A [Data Explorer] query showing the questions that would have been warned (not blocked).</p>

<li>Who can do it? </li>
<li>If we add a term and then later realize it was a bad idea, can it be reversed?</li>
<li>Is the filter simple terms only, or can it use regular expressions?</li>
<li>Can we link the warning message to advice? e.g. ""Questions about Sujarkama's theory of Mesionic Inference have tended to get closed quickly because we generally feel that it is unclear what you're asking. Before you post this question about Sujarkama, we suggest you review [ask] and <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/633/1401"">this advice</a>.

<p>It caught my eye because it had a different and more eye-catching title (""interruption"" instead of ""infant exposure""). That's probably an alternate name for the practice, or perhaps he mistranslated ""abortion"", but it made it look like the question would be about interrupting other people's conversations, rather the practice of abandoning unwanted babies as a matter of social practice.</p>

<p>The problem I have here is that the question was closed without comment. If I can, I'll add a comment in such places where the reason seems fairly obvious to me, but here it doesn't. The given close reason (""about social sciences other than history"") is so vague I can't really get a grip on it. If I had to take a guess myself, I'd guess that most of the closers were a combination of people who misunderstood the question due to the title (like I kept doing), and people who thought it was likely a veiled anti-Semitic attack.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>e.g.  I read on Wikipedia that the Pryce baronets went extinct with the seventh baronet.  Is that true?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, thank you for having done at least some preliminary research.  I appreciate that you've made an effort.  That said, unless you have a reason to doubt the fact in question, why are you asking?  Do you have a reason to believe that there was an eighth Pryce baronet?  Are you confused about how a baronetage (or any other title) go extinct?  Do you doubt the existence of the Pryce baronetage at all?  </p>

<p>Some of those questions are valid.  But if your question is just ""I read X, is it true?"" 
then you're wasting your own time, let alone mine.  There are a huge number of assertions on wikipedia; we could fill up the H:SE question queue with questions about whether any given assertion is true.  H:SE would wind up being a copy of Wikipedia.  If your only question is whether an arbitrary assertion on wikipedia is true, then I'm going to downvote your question.  If I'm having a bad day, I'm going to downvote your question, then answer it by citing the wikipedia page.</p>

<h2>Example:</h2>

<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/39197/1401"">Did Yuri Gagarin really hear a ticking sound during his journey into outer space?</a></p>

<p>I was challenged on this one recently on the grounds that a movie put words into the mouth of a real man; (leaving aside the problem that the question does not include a quote)  By this principle, we can question any quote in any movie.  1776 has Thomas Jefferson writing ""When in the course of human events..."" is that true?  Lincoln has Abe Lincoln saying ""hello""... is that true?   Movie X depicts John F Kennedy as a featherless biped, is that true?  Book Y says that Robbert Goddard had five fingers on each hand, is that true? Unless you provide some justification, some  reason, then all of these are equally absurd.   Gagarin was in a tiny cockpit crammed full of electromechanical equipment and he heard a sound typical of electromechanical equipment. Where is the surprise?   He was in a relatively tiny capsule exposed to extreme temperature and pressure fluctations - my house make a ticking nose when the wind blows.  I'd be more surprised if he didn't hear a ticking sound; if OP had asked, ""Why didn't Gagarin hear any strange noises during his space flight?"" I would have started work on that question, because <strong>that</strong> would be surprising. (I'd frankly doubt it and ask for a citation, because citing every non-trivial assertion is simple courtesy). Is there a reason why hearing this sound is surprising?  I have no doubt that there is - but OP hasn't told us that.  If you doubt the existing narrative, you're obliged to explain <em>why</em> you doubt it.  Asking a question here is a request for a group of strangers to exert effort on your behalf.  Simple respect suggests that if it isn't obvious, that you explain why you find the existing narrative unsubstantial. </p>

<h1>How to fix the problem</h1>

<p>If you have a reference to a ninth baronet Pryce and you need to reconcile the statement in Wikipedia with evidence you have elsewhere then <strong>include in the question references to both bits of evidence (the Wikipedia page and whatever other evidence you have).</strong></p>

<p>If you don't understand how a baronetage can go extinct, then your question isn't ""is that true?"", your real question is ""how does a baronetage go extinct?"" or ""How does inheritance of a baronet work?"" (that's actually a rather good question).</p>

<p>If Gagarin spent hours checking the ticking noise against each of the instruments in his spacecraft and measured it to ensure that it was regular and did tests to exclude other possibilities, <strong>then mention that</strong>.</p>

<p>If you doubt the existence of the Pryce baronetage because all English titles are the invention of our reptilian overlords, then I need to know that so I can cast a close vote rather than a downvote.</p>

<p>If you don't understand what a baronetage is, then I suggest you do a couple of google searches before you ask, and incorporate that research into your question.</p>

<p>If the assertion in Wikipedia sounds <strong>implausible</strong>  to you, then I'd do a bit more research and make your doubt <strong>explicit</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Wikipedia says that George W. Bush and Sylvester Stallone are the same person; after all they were born on the same day, and they are both white males, given all that evidence, how can you tell the difference between them? I've done some research and I cannot find any photographs that contains both of them, but the underlying claim sounds a bit suspicious to me."" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The nice thing about phrasing the question that way is that we can answer it if we can find a single photograph showing both of them, or some other irrefutable evidence that they are different people.  </p>

<p><em>Questions that involve more research are less likely to get downvotes than questions that involve little or no research.</em></p>

<h2>Counterexample</h2>

<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/33560/1401"">Please confirm this fragile assertion</a> - This is a great counterexample; OP's real question is to confirm or deny a fragile (single source) hypothesis. I believe this is part &amp; parcel of the practice of history.  We have to be careful not to phrase it as  a source request, but rather as a request to support or rebut a hypothesis.

<p>I'm studying Chinese history on my own and hope an expert in the field could recommend a/the leading, scholarly history covering from the Qing through at least the beginning of Deng Xiaopeng's reign. I've checked syllabi of college classes, Amazon reviews, and a few other sources; it is impossible to separate wheat and chaff without expertise.</p>

<p>I found the following, for what it's worth:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Search for Modern China (Third Edition) by Jonathan Spence: I read this through the Taiping Rebellion and stopped (which is why I'm now looking for a replacement). Spence writes exceptionally well and this book seems very highly regarded. I was surprised to find key questions often overlooked; important background frequently omitted; and an almost complete lack of footnotes, any other discussion of his sources, or discussion of their uncertainties -- we are given only his analysis to take at face value. He says this Third Edition has many edits; perhaps earlier editions were different?</p></li>
<li><p>A History of Chinese Civilization by Jacques Gernet, J. R. Foster, Charles Hartman (translated from French): This seems well-regarded, but I'm not sure if the Amazon reviewers know what they are talking about. Also, less than a third of it covers the period I'm interested in.</p></li>
<li><p>China: A History by Harold Tanner: Also seems well-regarded, but again it's hard to tell and it covers all of Chinese history.</p></li>

<li>EDIT: Question rejected at Meta; I'm told I got ""bad advice"" so steps 5-13 were a waste of my time and effort. I'm recommended to make yet another post asking that the original main site question be re-opened. I'm also offered links to more reading on rules As you can imagine, this is a frustrating, time-consuming experience and I'm stopping here. (Generally, everyone is polite and considerate, which I do appreciate; thank you!)</li>
</ol>

<p>At this point, nobody has talked about history yet; it's been all a time sink and frustration. I suspect you lose a few users along the way there. In fact, the only reason I completed the process was to post this feedback. In particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>Far too much focus is on rules; it reminds me of Wikipedia (not a good thing). I just want to talk about history, not become an expert in SE.</li>
<li>The rules are unclear. I read the 'manual' (something most users don't do) and somehow still didn't understand[1].</li>
<li>Prohibitting asking for book recommendations in a history forum would seem to eliminate much value for no apparent gain. My question was pretty specific and I searched for answers before posting.</li>
</ul>

<p>[1] <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">Help</a> says the site ""is not about ... Asking for reference material"". I suppose that could apply to my question, but it's ambiguous.  'Reference material' could mean primary sources, specific citations (e.g., 'where is a cite for Napoleon's height'?), reference books (e.g., 'Biographical dictionary of American History'), or several other things. I wouldn't think a narrative about Chinese history is considered ""reference"" and I expect that's exactly what a history forum would discuss. If it's confusing to me, I expect others will be equally confused. Also, I'm not sure why my question is appropriate on Meta. Again, look how much time is spent reading, puzzling over, and discussing rules!</p>

<strong>LAWS</strong> are ambiguous - it's the nature of the beast. There are always different ways to slice and dice and interpret rules/laws and
some people will be more ""liberal"" and others more ""conservative""
about it. Sometimes you do feel bad that a question is closed - you
can try editing it, restating it in a different way, etc - sometimes
it works, sometimes not. We do have a user driven community here and
you won't always see eye to eye with the community at large - again,
it's the nature of the beast: Some people will inevitably ""fall through the cracks"" in any system of rules or laws that is community driven and seeks to regulate a large number of people.</li>

member of the site, has given you a ""professional's"" answer and SE

many questions closed because they constitute a ""request for

has hinted, if you're comfortable enough on the internet to be
seriously engaged on SE sites, doing google/wikipedia/amazon
searches etc should be a simple matter and you'll find plenty of
references. I personally have found that using Amazon together with
their user reviews is often an excellent resource for reference
material. Most history books that are not ""hard core"" scholarly
works will be found on there with plenty of user reviews for the
good/popular ones - you can get the good the bad and the ugly from
there. The good articles in Wikipedia also cite, and often link to, valuable source material.</li>

The same certainly goes for politics. That's just expected. If the community at large feels it is a good answer, it will get enough upvotes to more than balance that out. If it isn't then it won't.

A distinguished scholar had called the lack of population transfer to resolve the latter conflict unprecedented.  I asked whether it truly is. That set off a firestorm I had not intended.  But one interesting point was made that leads to a more fascinating issue -- if population transfer is a war crime, then, arguably, the resettlement of refugees to end a conflict, as was done in India/Pakistan, and more recently in the former Yugoslavia, as well as following several African tribal and ethnic wars, would be a war crime, too.  Moreover, the Saudi Arabian proposal for peace in Palestine, as well as the aborted proposal at Camp David at the end of Clinton's administration, which would have forced Jews to leave their home, would also be war crimes.  Is the alternative to keep refugees in camps until they have a home to get back to?  Do we force Suni and Shiite neighbors who have been fighting tooth and nail with each other in Iraq to live together whether they like it or not, and whether their countries borders are redrawn creating a situation where they would be forced to live in a hostile environment.  Would the UN and warring nations be barred from redrawing their maps to say ""this side is for people of the X and that side is people of the Y"" and de facto establishing incentives for the residents to leave homes they and descendants have lived in all of their lives.</p>

<p>The core premise of the StackExchange model is that it is <em>not</em> an encyclopedia, meaning there is no editorial board responsible for verifying answers. Instead, the model calls for a site filled with experts (of varying levels of knowledge and fields of expertise) who, through their collective voting, let <em>good</em> answers rise to the top, and <em>bad</em> answers sink down.</p>

<p>An important distinction in that last paragraph is the very fluid definition of good and bad answers. Again, this is neither an encyclopedia nor an academic course. The purpose of <em>answers</em> is to answer <em>questions</em>, and one answer might be more extensively researched and wider in scope, but if people don't feel it answers the original question, or focuses too much on issues that the OP didn't care for, it might get downvoted. An answer with good information but an inappropriate tone might get downvoted by some people, but upvoted by others who don't care about that metric. Some might decide that structuring an answer like an essay, divided into subheadings and paragraphs, might be a good thing and deserve an upvote. Others might see it as unnecessary verbiage. </p>

<p>The second issue, closely tied to the first, is that an answer's value to the site is determined collectively. The premise, again, is that a large enough group of experts will, on average, reward good answers and discourage bad ones. The fact that this is <em>collective</em>, and based on a crowd-sourced system where everyone down- or up-votes based on personal preferences, means that one shouldn't cry foul over every downvote. It means that some people disliked it <em>as an answer</em>, even though they might be fine with the research in it. </p>

<p>Factual incorrectness is, of course, always bad and should be discouraged. However, since the standards for voting aren't as stringent as in publishing, <em>wrong</em> information will sometimes be upvoted. Again, this shouldn't be a problem if there are enough downvotes to balance it out. Given enough users, enough experts, enough votes, a downvote or two won't matter to a good answer.</p>

<p>It's true that History.SE is still a small site, and an answer might languish without getting the attention it deserves, and end up with a negative rank, all votes totaled, when that is entirely undeserved, just because not enough people read it and decided to vote. The solution to that is to popularize the site! Bring in more people, more active readers and voters, and let the masses get the system working.</p>

<p>How do you KNOW their opinions are more biased than yours?  If a quotation was reported in a publication you think has a bias, that doesn't mean it isn't factual.  A ""quote"" or ""fact"" in pro-Arab Al Jazeera may be as true or could be as false as one in the pro-Israeli settler Arutz Sheva radio and internet network.  Either's ""facts"" could be out of context, too!</p>

<p>Let me tell you a personal story:  In 1996 I was with my family for my daughter's bat mitzvah in Jerusalem.  During our first days there, there was a lot of Arab publicity about how they were going to build an addition to Al Aqsa Mosque in Solomon's Stables -- which were not neither stables nor Solomon's, but was part of the Herodian Temple complex and should have been excavated by archeologists before any building commenced.  The Waqf -- the Moslem caretakers of the mosque would have nothing to do with archeologists.  Archeologists were demanding something be done, but the government wasn't taking the bait, I though.  They figured that Arafat was looking for a fight, and was looking for an excuse.  Nothing happened that day.</p>

<p>On the day after Yom Kippur we planned to see the Kotel tunnel tour, which at the time was an archeological dig underneath the housing in the Arab quarter adjacent to the Wall of the Temple Mount (aka the Kotel).  From the Kotel plaza, where people pray at the Wall, the tunnel runs directly north in the direction of the Dome of the Rock, but on the other side of the mamouth walls placed there by Herod and are about six feet wide, I'd guess.  No way did we ever go east of the Western Wall.  Impossible.  Until that day, the tunnel patrons had to exit out the same door they entered, at the plaza.  But that day, for the first time ever, an exit into the Arab quarter had been opened and my tour was the first to go out it.  We were told that the city government wanted us to buy from the Arab merchants in the Old City, and also, the exit would solve traffic jams inside the tunnel.  Fine.  </p>

<p>We were also told, that since we were the first, we would be on television, and should not say anything provocative.  We didn't.  Before we left, we saw a well dressed Palestinian Arab in white clothing come down the exit to inspect us. I never saw or heard of that man again, despite all of the events soon to occur.  On our exit, I saw lots of tv cameras, but never saw myself on television (probably because we were too well behaved -- bad television).  I saw lots of police in riot gear, and all of the Arab shops but one were closed in protest of our exit.   As far as I knew, I was no threat to the Arab people or Palestinian statehood.  </p>

<p>We walked from the Arab Quarter to the Jaffa gate and went to the post office to buy stamps to mail postcards.  Just then, I saw cars of riot police heading for the Kotel.  I told my wife that there must be trouble.  When we got to our room, CNN showed Yassir Arafat claiming that my tunnel tour had gone underneath the Al Aqsa mosque (to do so we would have had to have gone to the other side of the six-foot Herodian wall and south and east -- we didn't -- also construction was completed seven years before).  That announcement, apparently, started four days of rioting and heavy casualties.  Today, a <a href=""http://www.palestinefacts.org/pf_1991to_now_kotel_tunnel_1996.php"" rel=""nofollow"">Palestinian ""fact"" site</a> does not attribute the claims of damage to Al Aqsa to Arafat -- although I heard it from his lips when he said it -- and have it has twisted the incident into a claim of an attempt to judaize the Arab quarter -- something that hardly seems worth four days of rioting.  </p>

<p>So let me turn the question back to you:  given my personal experience, should I trust ""Arab propaganda""?  If you quoted that site to me, should I vote it down?  Not everything it said is a lie.  It might only earn two pinnochio noses on the Washington Post fact checker column. And my gut feeling -- that Arafat was looking for an excuse to have a small riot, may not be the correct context, or then again, it might.  Who knows?</p>

<p>There is much that goes on where we only have half of the facts and context.  It is difficult for any of us on the outside to know what is the whole truth.  It is similarly impossible for those closest to the facts to understand the context.</p>

<p>If my house has been destroyed by a missile or members of my family killed, I don't want to hear context.  I don't care.  And whether I'm an Arab or Jewish Palestinian, I'm not going to go on television and discuss the politics or the military reasons or even the depths of international law. All I'm going to do is cry, and maybe even want vengence. And if I'm a reporter at the scene, I'm not going to ask the survivors about that, but I will take video images because death destruction and tears of the grieving make good television.  The truth might not come out, really, but leet those who want the truth wait for 100 years the historians from the eventual winner's side to sit down and figure out which truth suits them best.</p>

<p>Yeah, I know, I created the question and thus I could be biased, but this question could really be answered within the confines of the question with a factual basis.

I'm going to provide my subjective opinions; turns out I didn't cast a close vote on this, so my opinions are not strictly responsive to the question, but I hope you'll take them in the spirit in which they are intended.</p>

<p>In my opinion, excellent questions are ""trapdoor functions"" - When the question is asked, the answer is difficult, but when someone supplies a correct, well researched answer, any reasonable observer can examine the question and answer and agree, ""Ahh! so that's the answer, I see it now, and I understand the question and the topic better.""</p>

<p>This was a list question - there wasn't <em>an</em> answer, there was a set of answers that could be argued without closure. (and we were well on the way to arguing without closure). In my experience, that is an indicator of an opinion based question. </p>

<p>""War"", ""Weapon"", ""end"", ""long"", ""cause"" - roughly 1/3 of the words in the question were subject to debate, and roughly 1/2 of the important words. That's another indicator that that the result I give won't be accepted by the guy sitting next to me.  Excellent questions have answers that when we look at them, we all agree, ""yes, that is the answer!"".  Opinion based questions frequently result in answers that spur yet further argument.</p>

<p>In my <em>personal</em> opinion, if someone had provided a perfect answer, I'm not sure that the Q&amp;A as given would have led me to a deeper understanding of warfare, civilian deaths, danger, history, or anything else.  </p>

<p>Closure isn't fatal.  Closure is an opportunity to revise a question.  In this case, IF this were a question that were important to me, I'd probably rewrite the question taking relevant comments into account, and try again. I think there is an interesting question buried in here, but I haven't the skill to revise it.</p>

<p>Neither was doing much of the main job of a tag description, which is to help users decide when a question is on-topic for that tag. In addition, I just have this thing about verbatim copying of website contents. I won't use the fancy P-word.

<p>Morality aside, if we really want to say verbatim ""what Wikipedia said"", we'd better serve our users to just link to Wikipedia in the tag wiki, so that they can go read the latest polished contents, not some random snapshot of it.</p>

<p>Now, all this being said, my personal philosophy on tag wiki edits on empty tag wikis is to be very generous. Something is almost always better than nothing (even a wrong something can be a good start and a spur for improvement). So I can see where stuff like this might slip through. </p>

<p>Now, out of the three non-meta questions you've had closed I personally voted to close one and would have voted to close another if it hadn't already been. </p>

<p>Your <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/14725/pattern-for-world-wars"">Patterns for World Wars</a> question is the one I would have voted for. That's simply because of this in the help centre:</p>

Genealogy
Asking for reference material
Predicting the future based on historical trends
Mythology
Conspiracy theories or pseudoscience
</code></pre>

<p>I agree with you though, that it would be an interesting discussion and I would enjoy looking into it. That said though, there isn't a definitive answer to it and it's always going to be very subjective; that's why I would have voted to close.  </p>

<p>Next, the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/14797/the-founding-of-rome"">Founding of Rome</a> question. I think is fine, it's a little thin on the ground and is close to being trivia, but I feel that a good, unique answer could have been written for it. Oldcat provided a reasonably good answer but I think that someone who knows a lot on the subject could provide more information.</p>

<p>One thing that might have contributed to it being closed could have been the attitude taken towards outside input into the question. I think the edits made were valid, and didn't change the scope, meaning or intention of the question - just improved it's format and provided more background to the reader. It might have wound people up, telling them that they cannot do something that the creators and moderators of SE allow, and that could have lead to the question being closed.</p>

<p>Finally, we have ""<a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/14231/have-adolf-hitler-ever-personally-witnessed-any-of-his-crimes"">Have Adolf Hitler ever personally witnessed any of his crimes?</a>"", the question I did vote to close.</p>

<p>I voted to close it because it was too general - I realistically shouldn't have selected the option I did; I should have selected ""Too Broad"". The number of crimes that Hitler committed is huge, and varies depending on who you are and from what perspective you look at it legally; i.e. International Law, National Law etc. Reducing the scope of the question to limit it to one area or specific type of crime would see me voting to re-open it.</p>

<p>As it stands though, it has two good answers, and there is an argument that if it has good answers then the question is of some value to the site.</p>

<p>The remainder of your questions have a substantial amount of upvotes, in fact many of the closed questions also gained upvotes.</p>

<p>What I'm saying is that out of the 3 questions you've made that have been closed 2 of them stand a good chance of being re-opened and answered if they were edited to reflect some of the feedback. </p>

Your posts in particular have generated comment trails that are exceed the guidelines of the site.  Your posts get tremendous regard.  You may wish that they generated more positive regard; many members of SE have offered suggestions that would garner more positive feedback. Drop the attitude, recognize that you are an equal member of the community, and that you will be subjected to the same standards as everyone else.  </p>

  I fail to see the relevance.  The help center clearly states, ""History Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for historians and <strong>history buffs.</strong>""  (emphasis added).  I don't recall the name of this particular rhetorical fallacy - it seems to combine ad hominem with appeal to authority.  It isn't relevant. There is no requirement to be a professional historian, just to be interested in history. You don't define the qualifications to participate, and you don't get to complain because people who follow the rules are participating.</p>
  
  <p>Much condescension and feeling of self value, for someone as partial, don't you think?
  I think this is full of attitude, but I think the underlying complaint is legitimate and deserves to be addressed. We all need to be more civil and respectful to one another. (I admit my hypocrisy. Despite my continued requests for civility, I have fallen short of the goal. I forget who accused me of ""withering sarcasm"", but I've taken that to heart.  I'm doing my best to be as civil as I can in this post.)</p>

That way we're not trying to decide a question about international law, we're consulting sources to determine if there is an internationally recognized principle or method to reach a determination. </p></li>
<li><p>This question borders on speculation - ""If .. arguably... would be""  Those words all cause my downvote finger to twitch.  The scope suggestions of H:SE discourage speculation and hypotheticals.   I'm not entirely sure how to resolve this - I don't know what the question would look like if the speculation were removed.   It might be that ""What are the criteria used to determine whether a forced resettlement is legal or not?""</p></li>
<li><p>I think there is an assumption about the nature of crime. If I take your house, that is a crime. If the government takes your house, that is eminent domain and it is entirely legal.  If I force you and your family to resettle, that is a criminal act; if the government forces you to do so, that is a legal act, and any attempt to resist that is illegal.  The situation you describe is a bit more complex because there is no world government (despite the fears of the wingnuts and the ardent desires of the fruitloops).  But if the resettlement is carried out as an attempt by the international community to resolve a dispute, then the action is arguably legal.  Of course I've use the word <em>arguably</em> (see prior paragraph) and <em>legal</em> (see first paragraph).  Again, I think the H:SE question probably runs something along the lines of ""What criteria has the international community historically accepted to determine whether a forced resettlement is legal?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I suspect the ultimate answer is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_of_heaven"" rel=""nofollow"">Mandate of Heaven</a> - the very pragmatic method of ""if it results in good rule, then it must have been the right choice; if it results in chaos and disorder, then obviously it was illegal.""</p>

<p>Not sure that helps, but I thought your question was good enough that it deserved an attempt at an answer.</p>

Once a piece of software is available to the general public, it is, by definition, a release, not a beta test. Calling your public release a ""beta"" is just like saying ""we are releasing this software but we think it sucks"". No software is perfect. You ever see Windows version 2.0? Now, that was BAD software, but at least they didn't call it ""beta"". Once you release software to the public, go with it, you have released the software.

<p>Furthermore, in software development, the beta testing phase is always a temporary phase before the final release. It's not an <em>evaluation</em> phase, in the sense that a software in beta will not be abandoned without a release if the beta doesn't fulfill expectations. It's purely a functional stage to reach more testers. In Stack Exchange, though, the 'beta' moniker suggests that a site is ""in probation"", and can be shut down at any point if it is determined that it will never reach the minimal criteria for existence. That's a completely different state of being compared to software's beta-testing phase.</p>

<p>In essence, these are two entirely distinct terms - do not try to apply logic or experience with software beta testing to Stack Exchange's beta sites, because other than sharing a name and a vague relation to being ""preliminary"", they are <em>separate</em> and <em>different</em> concepts. </p>

<p>I can only offer my personal opinion. 
First, make the title a question. That helps make it very clear what you are asking. 
Second, I think the close reason is incorrect. I agree with you that what you are asking is relatively clear. I don't believe I voted on this; if I had, I would have suggested that it was trivial; as the comments indicate, the answer can be found with a Google search.   The easiest way to improve the question is to do (and document) the preliminary research.  </p>

<p>Part of the problem is that no matter how you <em>intended</em> your question, questions that ask ""What was the influence of X on Y?"" tend to fall into two groups:</p>

<ol>
<li>Homework questions - the teacher/instructor/professor has taught to this question and the student hasn't bothered to do the reading/research/attend the lectures.  These are bad questions for H:SE because <em>as stated</em> they are really only relevant to that class.</li>
<li>Beer and Pretzel questions - someone asked a random question and rather than do any research, they come to H:SE and ask for others to do the work.  These also frequently fall into the ""<a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/gorilla-vs-shark/"">Gorilla vs. Shark</a>"" category of questions where there isn't an answer, there is no meaningful way to reach an answer, there is no agreement on what a good answer would be or how to recognize it, and even if we found an answer, nobody would really care.  This kind of question is excellent for Symposia at the Pub, but very bad for Stack Exchange.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the case of your question, I would first have rephrased it to ""What influence did the cold war have on the formation of the internet?""  Then I'd have included some preliminary research. First I've have defined /referenced the two terms.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Al Gore created the internet; On 3/9/1999, the internet sprung forth fully formed from his his forehead like Athena from Zeus' skull. The internet is defined as a set of tubes through which pictures of cats flow. </p></li>
<li><p>Charles Stross' Laundry file defines the cold war as the conflict between subterranean extraterrestrial entities and a possessed cat. (sorry for the spoiler). As such the cold war began prior to the beginning of recorded civilization and ended in 2012 at the end of the Laundry Files.  The key features of the cold war are a fixation on exotic mathematics and computer programming.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(in case the pop culture references aren't obvious, those answers are wrong; no matter how amateur your research, you can do better than those two bullets.) I would have used Google and Wikipedia (and possibly Snopes) to check to see if there are any existing theories about the origin of the internet, and I would have referenced that research in the question so that people don't waste their time searching out the obvious.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is also useful to understand why you're asking; what difference does it make if the cold war influenced the internet? If the cold war didn't influence the internet are you looking for what did influence the internet, or are you actually looking for knock on effects of the cold war on the civilian technological base? </p>

<p>I think the problem comes in when the poster thinks there most likely <em>is</em> an example (and thus answering the question should be easy), but in fact nobody can find one, turning the question into a ""prove a negative"" problem.</p>

<p>In some cases, like the first question I linked, I think its probably safe to give a weaselly negative answer. Something along the lines of, ""Yes, that appears to be the largest <em>known</em> simultaneous death penalty verdict ever"". If a true counter-example pops up, accepts can be changed.</p>

<p>The second question is actually a good example of that. One of the answers is a pretty good exemple of how to answer a ""prove the negative"" in the negative (and in excellent pirate patois as well!). Unfortunately, I happen to know of one, so I never selected that answer. (I don't usually post questions I know the answer to, but it was a special post for Talk-like-a-pirate day.)</p>

<p>Like I mentioned on there, I do think that this should be a perfectly legitimate question for a board on history. My argument was that from my understanding finding sources is a typical component of the day-to-day of a historian researcher, and that questions of this sort would likely for the most part produce perfectly useful and searchable answers to questions common in the field.</p>

<p>@Semaphore argued that questions like this don't have a definite answer (as mentioned as an argument above), which may indeed correct (though as @RosalindRei points out in the comments in the question above, her case should have a definite answer in the shape of a short list). It might still be worthwhile to remember that this requirement originates from the original stackexchange where sticking to the 1Q&amp;1A format was an important point as there were a lot of different <em>opinions</em> floating around with about more or less anything (this programming language versus that, etc.). This may not be so on this board, especially when it comes to listing references.</p>

<p>While I am not a historian, I do feel strongly in favour of H:SE being a resource useful to actual researchers in the field. From my experience with Mathoverflow and from talking to historians, I believe our worlds to not be all that different in this respect. Thus I feel I must point out that I have benefited immensely from both reference requests and more open questions on that site.</p>

<p>In regards to this it may be interesting to note that Mathoverflow solves the problem of open questions (1Q possibly many A) using a big-list tag and making the question community wiki (meaning posts are more freely editable, and that contributors and the asker don't get reputation points). This is not unlikely to produce a number of useful resources here, as it has done there. Further, in opening up this venue H:SE will not immediately deter historians interested in using this site from asking what I believe to be perfectly reasonable questions for a historian to ask.</p>

<p>A couple examples of useful resources on Mathoverflow stemming from questions with more than one valid answer:</p>

<p><a href=""https://mathoverflow.net/questions/100265/not-especially-famous-long-open-problems-which-anyone-can-understand"">https://mathoverflow.net/questions/100265/not-especially-famous-long-open-problems-which-anyone-can-understand</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://mathoverflow.net/questions/35468/widely-accepted-mathematical-results-that-were-later-shown-wrong"">https://mathoverflow.net/questions/35468/widely-accepted-mathematical-results-that-were-later-shown-wrong</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://mathoverflow.net/questions/879/most-interesting-mathematics-mistake"">https://mathoverflow.net/questions/879/most-interesting-mathematics-mistake</a></p>

<p>Since I myself have asked for references on Mathoverflow, where the policies are more in line with what would be useful for a researcher in the field (their policies initially developed independent of the original Stackexchange), and this produced (if several) good answers without having to resort to neither big-list nor community wiki, I'll share that question as well:</p>

<p><a href=""https://mathoverflow.net/questions/68936/source-on-functorial-algebraic-geometry"">https://mathoverflow.net/questions/68936/source-on-functorial-algebraic-geometry</a></p>

<p>As for how to encourage good requests for references and discourage the lower quality questions, I suspect the nature of history as a subject means that this will not generate poor answers.</p>

<p>If I am to propose a change to current policy it may be to allow reference requests, but encourage the asker to be specific to the point where--and maybe present an argument for that--it is feasible a complete answer would consist of a fairly short (and probably slowly expanding) list of reference material. From there it's a question of common sense:</p>

<p>E.g., a request for introductory material on recent European history would be too general as a question (but could still generate an interesting resource via a big-list tag and community wiki, as per Mathoverflow), while a properly delineated question like the one by @RosalindRei in the top of this answer would be totally fine with no ifs or buts.</p>

<p>Plainly wrong. For example he can conduct a simple search on the British national archive website to show him just how much is in the public domain, and moreover how recent such material can be.</p>

<p>I originally posted for references on the history of ethnopsychiatry which is an incredibly small field compared to the historiography of world war I or Stalinism which were the topics of examples given of posts which supposedly make specific, legitimate reference requests. Hence, anyone who deems themselves suitably qualified to answer my question (i.e. have read the relevant literature and which topics/sources have been covered or not) would necessarily converge on a small number of unattended sources. If one is familiar enough with the literature in a specialist area one would be able to identify the major debates within it and evidence already used to support arguments. </p>

<p>Broad requests are necessary also in preliminary research especially if like in my case research is being conducted independently of an institution - I've had to collate a reading list and identify major works independently so potentially could have blind spots. I could narrow my request to sources that would be available to me at a major library or online as I am not able to travel to seek archival material in different countries. But again, of course, anybody in a position to recommend I rifle through the patient records of a Transvaal psychiatric institution would also be able to answer my original question perfectly efficiently too. </p>

<p>However, I have two basic issues with limiting our scope that far. The first is practical. For example, there's no Anthropology stack right now to direct people to, so closing anthropology questions just for being anthropology helps <em>nobody</em>. The poor user doesn't get their question answered, and this beta stack has one less question it could sorely use. Perhaps when we make it to ""release"" it would make sense to break anthropological questions off into their own stack, but for now one stack covering both seems to be plenty.</p>

<p>The other is more philosophical. When you get into ancient history, records are nice to have, but we don't have nearly as much as we'd like. It is only sensible to use archeological finds, linguistic studies, DNA etc. both to fill in the gaps, and to check (or perhaps in cases even correct) the written record. Not doing so, simply because those are other disciplines, would be bad science.</p>

<p>You could then argue, ""Well yeah, but once there flat out is no record, surely that's no longer History!"" Perhaps technically yes. But I don't see drawing the line at 100% reliance on non-written information to be any less arbitrary than drawing it at 99%, or 80%.</p>

For reference, there are currently <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/american-revolution+religion"">no questions with that combination</a>.

<p>In fact, its long been my contention (some here disagree), that the chief problem with requests for references is that they are questions with multiple correct answers (aka: list questions). So I'd argue that last statement alone would allow us to get rid of the entry about reference material (although it still might be useful as a way of making a very common case of list question more explicit). </p>

<p>I think I'm in agreement that there are some cases (eg: asking what the source of our information about a particular detail at a particular event is) that are inarguably a request for a reference, and ought to be 100% on topic. But its OK precisely because that question is not a ""list question"". There exists a single correct answer.</p>

<p>So what I'd like to see is the entire shebang distilled down to something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is not about: Questions with multiple correct answers, each of
  which are arguably correct. (i.e. ""list questions"", particularly lists
  of references)</p>

Sadly, the other answer was clearly written by a total buffoon, and should probably have been deleted.</p>

<hr>

<p>On the one hand the question itself might be historically incoherent to those in the know.</p>

<p>For instance: <em>""Which German composer invented the piano?""</em></p>

<p>Such questions can only be answered by critiquing the question directly. An exhausting and sometimes fruitless exercise as you may not be able to clean them up even with the OP's input; as you end up semantically replacing both the handle and the head of the axe - so is it even the same axe?</p>

<hr>

<p>On the other hand the question might coherent but unanswerable with the knowledge and resources at the disposal of the current stack exchange membership. Perhaps - in so far as we possess the arrogance to speak for all historians - not answerable by <em>any</em> historian with current sources, tools and absence of a time machine.</p>

<p>For instance: <em>""How much of the annual budget of Pharaoh Khufu's regime was allocated to tomb building?""</em></p>

<p>We can answer these as unanswerable or close them as unanswerable; but we run up against problems either way<sup>1</sup>. If we answer them as unanswerable, then the first person to post gets votes for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence"" rel=""nofollow"">proving a negative</a>; hardly fair, and hardly pleasing to most OPs and people accustomed to negation being in comments only. If we close them as unanswerable; we don't allow for someone knowing the answer, partial answers, duplicate unanswerables with the better content<sup>2</sup>, or incentivising people to explain authoritatively why it's unanswerable<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Then you have what I call the ""zero or many"" question:answer paradox. These are questions where a quantifiable answer exists but it's either zero or many answers.</p>

<p>For instance: <em>""Was there a king that had seven legitimate sons?""</em></p>

<p>It's a paradox in so far that instead providing <strong>0</strong> <em>(no answer - implicit)</em>, <strong>1</strong> <em>(no answer - explicit)</em> or <strong>N</strong> answers <em>(subset of known or knowable answers)</em>, the question is closed as too broad or opinion based because it didn't resolve to precisely one answer. When in practice, if a question has multiple valid answers then the question should <em>have</em> multiple answers<sup>4</sup>; not none to frustration of the OP.</p>

<hr>

<p>So. To return to the basic criteria of: <strong><em>Does it add value?</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If the question isn't historically coherent and you can't fix it: <em>Close</em></li>
<li>If question is unanswerable and the OP wants the question addressed as-is<sup>5</sup> <em>and</em> this is the first time we've seen this question: <em>Answer why the question is unanswerable at the current time. Should include the Why so as not to cover for personal ignorance.</em></li>
<li>If the question is unanswerable and we've see it before, more or less as worded: <em>Close with appropriate duplicate link</em></li>
<li>If the question, if answerable, allows for multiple equally valid answers: <em>Allow any answer and applicable voting on quality of said answers until the high threshold is met for putting the question on hold / freezing out extra answers.</em></li>

Assuming the comment is truly egregious, or the commenter has exhibited a repeating pattern of disruptive behaviour, the responding moderator may proceed to warn them via a private e-mail or suspend their account. Moderators are generally encouraged to warn on first offense and only suspend when a behaviour persists, but the decision is completely up to the responding moderator<sup>1</sup>. </p>

<p>This is the general approach on all Stack Exchange sites. And it's far from foolproof. I've been moderating two sites for some time now, and I can tell you that it's <em>extremely</em> easy to miss a pattern of abusive comments. We do have access to a full history of comments (including deleted ones), but unless we have a good reason to go look at it, we won't. </p>

<p>If you happen to spot a repeating behaviour that hasn't been handled properly, please consider using the custom flag to clearly explain what's going on. A flag message like: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey, this guy has been posting abusive comments for a while now, could you please take a closer look?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is probably all you need to do to help the responding moderator realize that there's something more there than a single abusive comment.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some reference questions might also ask <strong>why</strong> a popular source is authoritative; which opens a whole other line of interesting enquiry.</li>
<li>The internet is notorious for not filtering authoritative from non-authoritative sources<sup>1</sup>; so in this sense <em>History.SE</em> can add value above and beyond the normal internet.</li>
<li>Some visitors might read the reference material and return to the site with interesting non-reference questions from the work they have just read. Put it this way, imagine you go to a library and the librarian refuses to tell you what books they have or where they are.</li>

<p>Regarding list questions, we need to ask ourselves for whose utility is the site: Ours and our <a href=""http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-gamification/"" rel=""nofollow"">point score</a>? Or the questers who visit?</p>

<p>If we care too much about the lack of concision of multiple good answers such that no single answer has reliable dominance, we tend to forget that to a visitor having people say <em>""We know the answer but we won't tell you due to game theory and SEO strategies you don't care about""</em> is <strong>intensely</strong> frustrating. Many answers becomes zero answers; by reductio ad absurdum.</p>

<p>So I wouldn't get overly concerned about reference questions devolving into list questions providing some threshold needs to be met on answers to such questions and duplicate list questions are diligently weeded.</p>

Nit picking about the boundaries of disciplines set up in 20th century liberal arts schools doesn't do anyone any good, particularly when we don't have stacks set up on the other side of most of those boundaries.</p>

<p>So a question about what humans did in prehistory should be decidedly <strong>on topic</strong>. However, a question about something like early hominid physiology (eg: ""Exactly how robust were Australopithecus Robustus' jaws?"", or <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/16868/what-are-the-typical-anthropometric-characteristics-of-the-skeletons-from-ancien"">this question</a>) would be an example of a pure anthropology question, and will almost certainly get closed as off-topic.</p>

<p>This seems to be the majority opinion, but it isn't universal. You can see from the other answer it isn't shared by everyone. So if you post a prehistory question, its a pretty good bet that today you will get at least a close vote or two.

<p>I don't know any of the mods here on History, so I don't know their motives for the migration. Another issue is that we don't yet have pro-tem mods on HSM (though there's been a discussion about it), so migrating it <em>back</em> (if that's possible at all) probably won't happen for a while.

<p>This may be a good time and place to discuss how we want to approach migrating questions to the new <a href=""https://hsm.stackexchange.com/"">History of Science and Math</a> stack.</p>

<p>This is a bit of an unusual situation, in that the new stack is essentially a proper subset of this one. To complicate matters further, we aren't exactly a thriving post-beta stack in desperate need of a split of some kind.</p>

<ul>
<li>avoid migrating any old (say more than 90 days or so) questions there.</li>
<li>for <em>new</em> questions, add comments informing the questioner of the other stack, and suggest copying or migrating their question there.</li>

<p>The close vote reason tells this. It may seem short and unspecific, but that's because these reasons come up again and again, it would be a waste of time for people to make the same comments to questions that fall under the same set of shortcomings.</p>

That caused the migration to be <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/10249/what-is-migration-and-how-does-it-work"">rejected</a>, which means the original post here on History should be back to normal again.</p>

<p>As already noted, one of the site moderators here moved the questions in response to several comments and flags requesting migration. The questions were, in fact, both on-topic at HSM, so there was nothing wrong with migration when looked at in isolation. I decided to reverse the migrations this one time to prevent them from becoming the start of a constant stream.</p>

<p>Now for the ""why"" of it all. The default action on any question should pretty much always have something to do with answers, whether it's reading answers or writing an answer. Only when something goes wrong should anyone start thinking about voting to close. That means that if a question is on-topic for History, it should probably stay at History, even if it's also on-topic at another site. This is especially true when a question is old, and/or already has answers, and/or predates the potential migration target site.</p>

<p>As T.E.D. mentioned, HSM is a ""proper subset"" of History, so cases like this are probably going to come up a lot, going forward. I encourage you to work with their community to figure out a better plan for handling migrations (and other interactions) in the future. To be clear, I'm not <em>necessarily</em> against further migrations; I just think it would be wise to have some dialogue. FYI, I've said roughly the same things to the HSM community in <a href=""https://hsm.meta.stackexchange.com/a/183/3"">my answer to their meta post</a>.</p>

The thought being is people may not know all of their questions yet and are looking for a resource they may not know the proper terminology, be experienced enough, it is not their area of expertise, or they are just curious and figure someone that regularly deals in historical research probably knows of effective resources / tools to use rather than them spending hours hunting and pecking through search engines.</p>

<p>I know <a href=""https://genealogy.stackexchange.com/"">Genealogy.SE</a> has also has some contention with such reference lists, but they also do not want to be doing people's research entirely for them (or as Mark stated <em>'doing their homework for them'</em>) so commonly provide references of where to check both in answers but also in the comments. </p>

<p>Another topic is, what is the reasonable amount of effort required before posting a question, does someone need to spend 3-4 hours researching before posting a question and then spend 30 minutes composing it and siting what they have already checked, or is a reasonable refined search and attempt to answer the question themselves OK? I would argue there needs to be a balance and also allow for some noise to facilitate new and existing users engaged and if someone seems like they put some effort into looking into it and not just drunkingly fired off a question because they saw something on History channel and was wondering more about it. </p>

<p>I think questions looking for an archival repository or source material that the questioner can then further research is useful if it is adequately scoped and specialized enough it would not be all over the internet. </p>

<p>Also I think questions about how someone would determine something are similar are also technically reference/resource method questions and should be allowed.</p>

<p>So for example and sake of discussion:</p>

<p>A) <code>How would I determine the people from Kent that participated in WWII?""</code> or do they need to specifically ask how many people from Kent were part of an armored division?</p>

<p>B) <code>How would I go about determining the daily supplies consumed by the 3rd Armored Division during WWII?</code> or would someone need to answer a more specific question like from September 2nd to September 15th, 1944 around the Battle of the Bulge? <em>(Yes the dates are not fully inclusive, but that is part of the point)</em></p>

<p>C) <code>Where can I find WWII AXIS prisoner lists captured by allied forces in the X region?</code> or does someone need to know who they are looking for or ask like how many officers were captured in the question so it is specific and not a reference question?</p>

<p>In A-C you are enabling the quester, where as the alternative versions the one answering is basically becoming the researcher on behalf of the question taker if it is something that may take extensive research to compile or answer.</p>

<p>My first 12 hours of actively trying to participate in this forum I have seen a lot of opinion and editorial comments which do not contribute to the answer or help refine the question. To someone getting used to the forum's 'feel' this is highly frustrating when it seems more 'snobby' than contributing. So that said opening up this class of questions some of that would need to also be kept in check and instead of giving a ""Well how could you not know the 3723rd digit of pie off the top of your head?"" style comment to the question and help the questionnaire refine it instead or answer it.</p>

<p>So to revise Mark's proposed:
<code>If you have a question about: . . . Historical events, specific references or seminal references,</code></p>

<p>to:
<code>If you have a question about Historical research methods and the locating of original or specific reference materials related to particular events.</code>.</p>

<p>I personally would come to the site more often if I knew it would provide more of these type answers of where to find information.</p>

<p>The issue is that such questions just don't fit our format. Questions here need to be capable of having a single answer worthy of receiving an ""Accept"". If someone asks ""What are good books on <em>Topic X</em>"", and I answer with 3 good books and someone else answers with 3 other good books, which answer should be accepted? How do you judge one better than the others?</p>

<p>I suppose we could try to answer such questions with a single Wiki answer (what does everyone else think?), but only convention would keep someone from spoiling the system by adding extra answers, and contributors to a Wiki answer can not receive any reputation reward for their good work.

<p>Requests for references are a common type of question people would like to ask on the History stack. This shouldn't be surprising, as the study of History is all about reading and analyzing references. Unfortunately, the StackExchange system is not well designed for this type of question, so these often get closed, as much as many users here would like to answer those questions.</p>

<p>Some stacks allow questions like this, but an examination of <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/book-recommendation"">the results</a> show that the content doesn't end up being very useful (low votes, seemingly capricious acceptances). What is needed is a way within the system to set up such questions in a way that does encourage the production of useful content.</p>

<hr>

<p>Under the proposed Reference List Question process, when a question that qualifies as a request for a list of references or books is submitted by a user, the following will happen:</p>

<ol>
<li>Someone<sup>1</sup> notices the nature of the question, and adds the tag <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/references"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;references&#39;"" rel=""tag"">references</a>.</li>
<li>Someone creates a community wiki answer. </li>
<li>Someone adds a comment to the question giving the questioner the option of either accepting the community wiki answer, or having the question held until they can rephrase it to no longer qualify as a list of references. The comment should reference this meta post for a fuller explanation to the original poster.</li>
<li>Users who wish to answer at this point may do so (with normal non-wiki answers). </li>
<li>Any references listed in a new answer will also be added to the accepted wiki answer by someone (preferably the person who posted the answer), with no commentary.</li>
</ol>

<p><sup>1 -""Someone"", in true StackExchange fashion, means any user who happens to notice that it needs doing and has the requisite reputation to perform this action. Users who notice and <em>don't</em> have the needed reputation may flag the item to request it get done.</sup></p>

<hr>

<p>Advantages of this approach: </p>

<ul>
<li>The compilation wiki answer puts the complete list of mentioned references at the top of the answers (regardless of voting activity). Being a wiki, no user will get reputation credit for it, as is right for a compilation of everyone's answers.</li>
<li>The other answers, all sharing the property of not being accepted, will be automatically sorted via the voting process. </li>
<li>Users who post answers will get reputation credit for the quality of their answers as per normal.</li>
<li>A random web surfer hitting our page should find first the question, second a complete list of references, and following that answers with references and explanations, sorted by quality (votes).</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, I believe it sets up a system where the existing SE engine will provide the proper incentive for good useful answers.</p>

<p>Drawbacks of this approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>It requires an extra step from the person asking the question. Often such people are brand-new users who are likely to have more trouble than most comprehending jargon like ""accept button"" and ""wiki answer"".</li>
<li>It requires extra moderation work from alert and knowledgeable users.</li>
<li>It doesn't solve the fundamental issue of such questions being solicitations of personal opinion.</li>
<li>Its a big experiment. As far as I know, no stack has done something like this. It seems to me it ought to work, but nobody knows how it will perform in practice.</li>

<p>A list of only the best books. We all know that there are more good history books than there are days left in our lives, so we only want to read what are truly the best.</p>

<p><em>What Does an Answerer Do If There is No Reputation To Be Gained?</em></p>

<p>Recommend a book that they absolutely love. This matches up well with with OP's wants.</p>

<p><em>What Does an Answerer Do If There is Reputation To Be Gained?</em></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I think the system breaks down here because we are basically setting up a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest"" rel=""nofollow"">Keynesian Beauty Contest</a>. There's going to be a mad race to be ""first"" when someone asks for recommendations about the Roman Empire, because answering ""Edward Gibbon"" might net you 400 easy points. But even after all of the big names are taken, some users will be incentivized to search Amazon for a book on Rome that hasn't made the list yet, and they'll add it hoping to get a few easy upvotes.</p>

<p>Maybe this is contradictory of me because I think the reputation system, though not perfect, generally creates healthy incentives for SE. I think that's because normally, the quality of our answers themselves is being judged--wanting an extra upvote pushes you to do extra research, extra proofing, extra thinking. But for book recommendations, the referent of our answers is being judged. You can't write a better answer (Edward Gibbon is already as good as he is going to get), so wanting an extra upvote pushes you to post additional recommendations. So I both worry that signal will get lost in the noise, and that some of these threads will become de facto pinned to the top of ""active questions.""</p>

<p>The only way to take reputation out of the equation would be to force all OPs to make their questions community wikis (which forces all answers to be community wikis) or to host these questions in Meta. (I know the latter isn't practical, but I'd actually like it because then we could freely downvote books we don't like without costing others rep.)</p>

<p>It's possible that community pressures would keep everyone in check, or maybe I'm too concerned that some users would try to game the system. I'm not opposed to experimenting with the proposal, but these are my initial concerns.</p>

<p>There's a difference between <strong>""What has historians said about X?""</strong> (definitely fact) and <strong>""Why did Y happen?""</strong> (possibly opinion). The former is a question of historiography, and factual, because historians write books and publish articles. Their opinions and conclusions are verifiable facts that can be cited and referenced.</p>

<p>The latter <strong>can</strong> be answered as a historiography, but usually is not. It tends to be approached as ""why do YOU think Y happened"", and when you pick one of ""several different interpretations based on available historical data"", that is <strong>exactly</strong> what  <em>primarily opinion based</em> is. Citing ""historical data"" doesn't mean an answer wasn't opinion based; in your example specifically, most answers were simply making assertions without really backing them up.</p>

<p>Having said that, a question like that can usually be easily reworded into a historiography one. For example, <em>""Why do historians think atomic weapons were used to Japan?""</em> is a historiography question. An answer will be able to cite historians to discuss what their views are. And it probably answers the original asker's question too.</p>

<p>The problem is that without specifying a focus on historiography. many people tend to write answers that reads like little more than their personal opinions.</p>

<p>Personally I might vote to close a ""why...?"" question based on how its written, and vote to reopen if it is edited to be actually about historiography.</p>

This is inspired by the <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2081/proposal-for-accepting-reference-list-requests"">proposal</a> for reference requests.</p>

<p>One questions arises though in terms of how to present the community wiki. So far there ate two approaches. Feel free to suggest others, of coruse.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Copy all the answers into the wiki, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/revisions/20900/2"">for example</a> my original post</p></li>
<li><p>Add a line in the wiki's list for each answer, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/revisions/20900/3"">for example</a> the edit by T.E.D.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Some advantages and disadvantages I see are that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Everything is in one place. The community wiki reads like a complete answer. Readers wouldn't need to scroll away for details. Likewise, items can be added to the list without having to make an additional post for the details. On the other hand, the list itself becomes cluttered, and we would have duplicated content.</p></li>
<li><p>Much less clutter in the community wiki answer. It's a concise list with links to follow for those interested in more details. Each item, in their own posts, can further be commented and voted on. On the other hand, information is dispersed through the whole thread, and sometimes there's no need or desire to create a separate post for a short answer.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For example, I would prefer to just keep the details for my item, the destruction of Wàn Sōng Temple, within the community wiki, since I don't really much point in posting such a short answer separately. But under scheme (2) I had to do so to provide some details on the event.</p>

<p>Lastly, I can think of a third solution: a mix of the two. Posters who prefer to put their answers separately can put in a short line and a link to the full answer for details. Those who don't want to, can instead make a reasonably sized section within the community wiki for details.</p>

<p>Either way, can we get a consensus on how to proceed with list type answers?</p>

I just don't think you have that if you don't have the (one and only) copy of the full text of an answer in the user's non-wiki answer.</p>

<p>My original idea was that the top (accepted) answer to the list question would just be the list. It sort of makes a TL;DR answer for the entire question. If you want details about each item, you scroll down to the answers that contain those items. If you like or dislike what the details have to say, the vote button for that item will be right there for you. </p>

<p>IMHO that's very important for the whole scheme to work. Expecting users to pick out one they like/don't like, and then go scrolling down past the (now ginormous) wiki answer to the specific user answer that mentioned it, and then vote, is just unrealistic. Plus, if the detailed text is all in their own answers, then you have the detailed text for list items automatically <strong>sorted in order of community votes</strong>. If our users think answer A is a great exemplar, but answer X is weak, the voting will automatically keep A listed more prominently than X. If you just chuck it all in the wiki, you lose that property.</p>

<p>One of the things I always look for in a question is 1) can it be answered with a clear and concise response, or 2) is it more likely to solicit discussion or opinions? You can almost always bet that any question that starts with the word ""why"" is going to be opinion based. (Why did Joe wear black shoes on Saturday?) Everyone will have their own opinion, so you'll never get a clear and concise answer. </p>

<p>Sometimes a question can be saved by a good answer, and I suspect that is the case with your first question. However, if it gets called up for a Close vote, I'll probably vote to close it because it truly is opinion based. There may have been some officers who have stated a specific reason, but without that there is no way anybody can give a clear and concise reason for why any officer would choose to do so. I can tell you why I ""think"" they did it, but that isn't an answer, it's just my opinion. </p>

<p><strong>Why did The Crown give assent to Apartheid legislation during the 1950s?</strong></p>

<p>Why did The Crown give assent to Apartheid legislation during the 1950s?  For example, the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act, Act No 49 of 1953 was assented to by the crown.  The relevant law in the 1950s was the South Africa Act 1909 as amended by the Status of the Union Act 1934.  HV Evatt describes the situation as being that the Crown, being the King or Governor General, could only act on the advice of their ministers. (HV Evatt 1936, The King and His Dominion Governors, 298-300)</p>

<p>Answer [IANAL] is: </p>

<p>The Crown could not refuse assent without launching a coup d'etat against parliament in circumstances that would have produced outrage against the Crown sufficient to result in an election that would surely return a ministry bound to dismiss the existing Governor General, and, potentially, force a republic.  Westminster inspired Crowns have generally sought to avoid such monstrous controversy, and the exceptions (to my knowledge Lang in NSW, Whitlam in the Commonwealth of Australia) have been intensely divisive.</p>

<p>The King or Queen or the Governor General could not legally refuse assent without having dismissed the executive council (effectively dismissing a government) and thus appointing a new executive council to advise them to refuse assent.  </p>

<p>The Governor General could not have legally advised the Monarch, and the Monarch could not have legally advised the Governor General on this course.  If the Monarch chose to intervene, they would have had to done so in person.</p>

<p>Such an action would have been an extreme and highly controversial use of reserve powers, amounting to a coup d'etat by the Crown over a policy issue (a bill supported by parliament).  Compare to the outrage in Australia when the Governor General had at least the excuse of a blocked supply bill as a fig leaf for what I believe amounted to a coup.</p>

I'm also going to specify in advance that I'm not mocking Canadian Coder - he merely happened to ignite a stream of thought.</p>

<p>If we set aside the question of power, then there are a couple of other interesting features of this question:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is a list question</p></li>
<li><p>It is a hypothesis question ([ask] discourages questions of the form ""I think X, don't you?"") - it will tend to generate discussion.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But I feel that this is a class of questions that perhaps are closed unfortunately. We also tend to argue about military history questions - there are many examples, but the most recent one I found was <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/21142/1401"">Stalingrad breakout</a>. </p>

<h2>My proposal</h2>

<p>I wonder if we couldn't encourage a class of questions that invite examination of a hypothesis.  What if the question above were reformulated as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hypothesis: The fundamental cause of war is a faction's desire for power</strong>
  Please provide examples and cite research that supports or weakens this hypothesis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Would Stalingrad breakout have been a better question had it been phrased: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""<em>Hypothesis: If Hitler had granted Paulus permission to redeploy to meet the relief column, then the Sixth Army could have broken out before year's end</em>""  There is still speculation &amp; opinion here, but that is, in my opinion, part of the practice of military history.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some nice features (I hope):
* A good example or counterexample can ""close"" the question - if I offer, ""Hypothesis: Capture of a cite requires numerical superiority"", then a single reference to King Saud's assault on Riyadh is sufficient to disprove the hypothesis.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>partial answers are OK.  Examples that weaken or strengthen are good. </p></li>
<li><p>Discussions of the predictive power or utility of the hypothesis are good</p></li>
<li><p>Discussions of military history are slightly less difficult. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I would continue the following existing constraints
* No counterfactuals:  ""Hypothesis: All wars are started by the illuminati to dominate the world's supply of orichalum and psionic slaves"", 
* No pure opinions: ""Hypothesis: My child is the best!"" 
* No Trivials ""Hypothesis: A shark could absolutely beat a gorilla in a fair fight"" or ""Hypothesis: All Lutheran Preachers in 1573 who were left handed preferred lamb to beef"" (absolutely no predictive power)</p>

<p><strong>Questions that can be answered historically</strong></p>

<p>The great thing about history is that to be an expert, you also need to know numerous other fields well. One corollary is that many questions that don't seem to be about history, can in fact be answered well by historians.</p>

<p>For example, a recent question impressed this upon me:</p>

<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/21201/was-the-flakpanzer-iv-used-against-infantry-if-not-what-was"">Was the Flakpanzer IV used against infantry? If not, what was?</a></p>

<p>There are currently two good answers; one answered the question by analysing the <em>Flakpanzer</em> itself, and would not be out of place on a purely-Military Q&amp;A site. The other answered the question via historical accounts.</p>

<p>And yet there are two close votes as of writing. My suggestion: go easy on these! Instead of asking, <em>is this about history?</em> let's ask, <em>can this be answered using history?</em> We should welcome more questions like these because they tend to attract laypersons into learning more about history.</p>

<p><strong>Analytical, subjective questions</strong></p>

<p>I think we shut these down too swiftly largely due to existing SE culture, namely one of the stock close reasons: <em>primarily opinion-based</em>. This reason works well for highly technical, ""hard"" subjects like software, but is unsuitable for ""softer"" subjects. History is not just a list of dates and events, the true value is in its analysis of motivations and interests, so we're missing out on a lot.</p>

<p>Not that I want every random schmo putting in their 2c about who started WWII or whatever, but expert insight by professional historians or backed by historical evidence is what I really find interesting. We should be more like sites like Programmers.SE in this regard, in that subjective questions are welcome as long as they draw from professional analysis and are backed by evidence. Feel free to downvote crap but let's go easy on the close votes.</p>

<p>For example, I really enjoyed a TV lecture series by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yi_Zhongtian"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yi Zhongtian</a> about the Three Kingdoms period, and contained gems like ""was <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Yu"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Zhou Yu</a> a jealous man?"" Which seems like the kind of trivial, subjective question we love to close, but it was answered by drawing from records of contemporary appraisals, opinions of historians as recorded in sources like <em>Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms</em>. Whilst not definitive, as some put it ""we can't read the minds of dead people"", it is very interesting nonetheless and is definitely related to history and can be answered by historical study.</p>

<p>Or <em>I have heard...</em>
or <em>I read that</em>...</p>

<p>I will downvote any question that includes this phrase. This is effectively the rhetorical fallacy <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Appeal to Authority</a> without going to the effort to invent the authority. There are two problems with this question, and I'll wish for the ability to downvote twice.</p>

<p>First, cite your source. It makes a big difference if the ""someone"" who once said is a 3rd century monk, a member of the Nazi party in 1938, Paul Krugman, or Noam Chomsky. They all have different biases; they are reliable for different classes of fact. If you don't identify the source, then we're both playing darts in the dark, potentially in an open field.</p>

<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/17711/1401"">Here</a> is a good example of a question where <strong>who</strong> said it is probably more important than <strong>what</strong> was said.</p>

<p>The second problem is that you have some facts; you are denying us those facts. You know who said what, but you're not supplying this information. That means you're asking me to start my research by repeating what you've already done. You're asking me to play a game where you know the rules and I don't.  You may not mean to be offensive, you may have the best intentions in the world.  But you're playing headgames and we're not married.  You've started your question with a signal that you are not honest; am I really motivated to do research on your behalf?  Do I really want to spend my time to research and write an answer only to have you say, ""no, I meant someone else...""</p>

<p>Doing history without sources is like doing programming without a keyboard, or building a building without any tools.  </p>

<p>This question is also frequently the same as the example given in the FAQ of a question NOT to ask. ""your question is just a rant in disguise: “__ sucks, am I right?”. If you're looking for people to confirm your opinion, H:SE is the wrong place.</p>

<h1>The Fix</h1>

<p>This is simple to fix.  Merely state who said what. Provide a citation if you can.  Give us the clues so that we can start the research to find the answer you're really looking for.  </p>

<p>""Disraeli said that ancient Greeks had no word for 'blue'; what color did they think the sky was?"" Still tough to answer, but there is at least a starting point for research. (A good question would have <strong>cited</strong> Disraeli's claim.)</p>

<p>More in general, however, I could see questions on mythology being turned into philological questions.

<p>Technically speculation on alternative histories is out of scope, but I don't think these two questions should be out of scope.  While I personally don't find them very interesting, I believe they fit solidly within the realm of historical scholarship.  Although it is phrased as an exploration of something that didn't happen but could have (counterfactual), the real emphasis is on identifying the factors that inhibited or facilitated the events in question and identifying the differences between two similar situations, and I think that is legitimate history.  Ultimately, I think that I'll learn something from a satisfactory answer to the question.  (I certainly learned something when I tried to answer the question and found out my assumptions were.... not as truthy as I thought they were.)</p>

<p>If others don't feel the need to draw a distinction between these and counterfactuals, then we can ignore the problem.</p>

<p>Well, this blogger has personal experience with Renaissance baking...</p>

<p><a href=""http://alicethecook.com/making-bread-the-renaissance-way/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alicethecook.com/making-bread-the-renaissance-way/</a></p>

<p>The start of the actual baking can be extrapolated, if I knew how long it would take to warm up the oven enough for baking... Assuming that they start work at 6AM, add the oven warming time to that, and then assume they work until sunset?</p>

<p>Also, assuming that Renaissance bakers made bread for the whole city... Figuring out the percentage of a city's population that are bakers, and how much of the population actually got bread, and assuming that each baker's business provides the same amount of bread, then an amount of bread in Renaissance-bread's-plural-counting-noun per day can be guessed/calculated...</p>

<p>Well, according to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome#Demographics"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia: Rome: Demographics</a>:</p>

<p>After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the city's population declined to less than 50,000 people. It continued to stagnate or shrink until the Renaissance. When the Kingdom of Italy annexed Rome in 1870, the city had a population of about 200,000. This increased to 600,000 by the eve of World War I.</p>

<p>So... assume 100,000 people in Rome... And, <a href=""http://www.engr.psu.edu/MTAH/articles/flower_of_wheat.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">since the middle classes and lower ate more bread than the upper classes</a>, assume everyone had 2 loaves of bread, daily.</p>

<p>Well, <a href=""http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/bread.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">[In] the United States... [1910's] per capita consumption of bread products was roughly 210 pounds.</a></p>

<li><p>non-trivial (cannot be answered by wikipedia or the first ten results of google.  You can improve the question by explicitly stating why wikipedia does not satisfy, or what you find confusing about google's results.)</p></li>
<li><p>Interesting (""How many tines were in the fork that Marat used in the fifth meal before his death?"" is not well formed; you could make it well formed by adding enough details to explain why that is interesting.)</p></li>
<li><p>Historical - the question can be answered by historical methods and sources. </p></li>
<li><p>Answerable - There is a clear definite answer - an arbitrary observer will be able to understand why that answer is the best answer for that question.   Avoid list questions (""Name all the people who died in 1433"", and opinion questions, ""Who's your favorite left handed person with brown eyes?"")  These tend to be questions that aim to drive discussion - we want answers not discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>Educational &amp; interesting. Questions that are extremely obscure or restricted to a narrow set of scholars are a bad fit.  ""Of the N variant copies of the Magna Carta that are available for study, what is the probability (based on Bayesian analysis of the script/hand) that two of the copies contain at least three paragraphs that were written by scribes who studied Latin under the same tutor?""</p></li>
<li><p>So general as to be unanswerable - Today we had a question that asked us to compare two policies.  We don't know which country, which century, or what the policies were.   Just ""compare these two policies"".  That generally indicates a homework question - the class is all working on the same time period/topic, so it is OK for the teacher to ask.  A couple weeks ago someone asked what kind of houses people lived in - was that in Alaska, Mesopotamia or Macchu Pichu?  in 1700BC or in 19995?  Make the question specific (which also makes it answerable, and making it specific allows you to add lots of links. Links mean that if someone else finds your question interesting, they can do some research).</p></li>

<p>I'm wondering why this was the case. I initially flagged one as spam - only seeing it after the edit - then realized that the version was not necessarily spam (perhaps it is, perhaps it isn't). Then I saw the revision history. This, I think, is closer to spam, because it serves only to promote a product or service - in this case, a system of religious beliefs.</p>

<p>I know some stacks as a matter of policy remove the contents of any post considered spam. This is usually noted, with a remark that anyone interested in seeing the original spam may check the revision history.</p>

<p>However, I'm a bit uncomfortable with users doing that for messages that have not yet been closed as spam. Yes, it was fairly obvious in this case, but still there's a principle here. Voting to close is merely a <em>claim</em> that its spam. The closure is the decision. Until that, I think it should probably be treated as a normal post, and not be subjected to utterly destructive edits.</p>

<p>I should also mention that I don't think that naked religious witnessing is <em>precisely</em> spam, but its awfully darn close to it, and no other close reason fits that kind of message better.</p>

<p>The first answer can be summarized as ""This depends on the region"" and the second on ""I've heard from xxxx that it was very obvious"".</p>

<p>Although I upvoted both answers and accepted one of them, and that my question was popular in voting, I realize that I did not get the answer I'd expect, but also that my question might not have been clear enough and not show enough previous research.</p>

<p>I'd want to narrow my question down to a particular region of Poland, and for a particular class of people that could be potentially expelled. The reason for that is that I have ancestors that had lived in those areas, and while they left Germany before the war, I wish to know if, hypothetically they stayed there and somehow survived the Nazi regime and the war, if they would have been expelled or not. I have absolutely no clue how they would have been considered ""german"" or ""polish"", especially considering I'm not even sure which language they spoke, officially they were german, but the ethnicity is not part of the official documents in Germany (as opposed to USSR for example).</p>

<p>The answers are not helpful to give me a hint on whether <em>they would have been expulsed</em>. Of course, this leaves the ""general"" question and enters into the ""personal"" domain, which is off-topic, thus while I've left my question general. This could almost go to Genealogy SE, but not quite.</p>

<p>However if I edit my question to ask about a particular category of people living in a particular region of Poland, that will instantly make both answers terribly off topic, and that would not be the answerer's fault.</p>

<p>However, if I do re-ask a similar question but with more insight, it will be marked as a duplicate of the first question.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thus I do not know exactly what should I do in order to get the answer I'd like to. However I'm also afraid such an answer does not exist, looking how random and lawless those expulsions were.</p>

<p>As I can see, I am not able to ask clear questions. On the chat I tried to explain my reasons to Semaphore, but also failed.</p>
<p>Many of my questions seem to be unclear and require comments to clarify. I try to write a long question because I want to show my research effort, so the question would be interesting (we spoke about <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/21475/2395"">this one</a>, so I will be referring to it, but for other questions remarks also apply). All <code>this citations</code> are taken directly from the question body.</p>
<ul>
<li>I performed a research and found out, that English kings used the title &quot;King of France&quot; for a long time (since Hunred-Years war until 1800).</li>
<li>The research revealed to me, that (some) French had problems with it, when <code>French delegates demanded that the King of Great Britain abandon the title of King of France as a condition of peace</code>. This was the first citation, from Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Then I showed that I understand that this was a ceremonial title (<code>Even if using the title &quot;King of France&quot; was only a part of some tradition, this should have been some problem for the French as after the Revolution they demanded to cancel using it.</code>), however, Mark C. Wallace and JMVanPelt wanted to explain me that <em>this was ceremonial</em>.</li>
<li>Because I had found out it could be some problem for (some) French, so maybe before revolutionary delegates somebody <code>beg/ask/demand the English to cease it?</code>. However, this was also not clear, because CGCampbell said, that <em>delegates did</em>. So again, this was not clear and I had to explain once more.</li>
<li>Because I expected that the the title &quot;King of France&quot; is ceremonial, I showed an example in the question (<code>I understand that when two kings met on some occasion (or an ambassador was introduced to a king) there was confusing presentation of two &quot;kings of France&quot;.</code>), why this could have been a problem for the French.</li>
<li>Then, Tyler Durden asked <code>What exactly is your question?</code>.</li>
<li>The question is stated in the title and it reads &quot;What was the reaction to English monarchs using the title “King of France”?&quot;</li>
<li>The <code>Did she beg/ask/demand the English to cease it?</code> <em>subquestion</em> is a possibility of a reaction of French Kings or French governments. I ask this <em>subquestion</em> to show, that I was thinking about the problem and I know some possibilities and answers, but I don't know if they are true.</li>
<li>The <code>How did other countries take/recognise this title (the largest/most important, like Spain, Holy Roman Empire, Austria, Poland/Lithuania, the Pope, Ottoman Empire maybe)?</code> means, that I am not only interested in what the French did, but also how other European powers considered the situation. I'd wish that answer will not focus on the France only. The question title <em>does not</em> use the word &quot;France&quot; in this context.</li>
<li>The <code>Was it just taken &quot;it's just a children's play, let the English perform it, if it's fun for them&quot;?</code> is another possibility to show that I did something before asking</li>
<li>The <code>Has anyone tried to clear this situation?</code> question is a summary.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know what was unclear here and why Semaphore says &quot;You write a lot of things&quot;.</p>
<p>This question is an example, but I had similar issues and comment-discussions in <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/23094/2395"">the question about UK bonds for Napoleon wars</a> which ended in a conclusion, that this is not a historical question, and some others.</p>
<p>So, ok, I can write short questions. This is an alternative:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What was the reaction to English monarchs using the title “King of France”?</strong></p>
<p>The English kings used the title &quot;King of France&quot;. Did anybody else respect it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Expected comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you made some research? Go, google it! First link, from Wikipedia, man! <code>French delegates demanded that the King of Great Britain abandon the title of King of France as a condition of peace.</code></li>
<li>Which kings of England?</li>
<li>Why do you think that this was a problem for France?</li>
<li>@2 I would say that also kings of Great Britain. But saying &quot;kings of England&quot; may also mean Alfred the Great. The question is too broad, I'm voting to close.</li>
<li>-1. The question shows lack of minimal research effort [<em>3 up-votes</em>]</li>
<li>This was a ceremonial title, you know? Check Wikipedia before asking: <code>The seven monarchs of this period [1603-1707] continued to use the style King/Queen of France, though their claim was merely nominal. None of them was willing to engage in military campaigns for France against the actual Kings of France Henry IV, Louis XIII and Louis XIV of France.</code></li>
<li>This question is off-topic because it <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/619/2395"">asks for a list</a> of French diplomatic actions.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't know how to improve my questions. What do I do wrong? Why are my questions not clear?</p>
<p>PS. Today I asked a question, which again led to the discussion in comments. I deleted it because I had performed <em>too few</em> research and were eventually able to find the answer myself. But anyway I also think that I just wanted to be precise.</p>

<p><strong>What research have I made?</strong> none (I don't know where to start). However, see the <em>What was I thinking as possible solutions?</em> section below.</p>
<p><strong>What I do not understand?</strong> the places related to these generals' titles lied outside sovereignty of United Kingdom neither they belonged to British monarchs.</p>
<p><strong>First clarification</strong> I know why the king gave these titles (because he wanted to honour them for their war effort). &quot;Why&quot; in this case means &quot;why did he do it with possessions he was not an owner and why he didn't give them some titles in Britain?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Second clarification</strong> I know how the king gave. &quot;How&quot; means &quot;how was it legally possible?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Third clarification</strong> Because me English is poor, I have no idea how to put the <em>First clarification</em> and the <em>Second clarification</em> into the question title so it will not be too long.</p>
<p><strong>What was I thinking as possible solutions?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It was made with agreement of French and Belgian governments or mayors or councils of the cities. Some delegates could be present on the ceremony.</li>
<li>This does not probably apply do Megiddo.</li>
<li>This was only a ceremonial title, so in some way no agreement or permissions with Belgian and French governments as well as with mayors or councils of Vimy or Ypres were necessary.</li>
<li>This was kept secret until the marshals died.</li>
<li>Officially, these we &quot;some other Ypres and some other Vimy, and it is just a funny coincidence&quot;</li>
<li>These were mayors' or councils' initiatives which were backed by common enthusiasm of citizens. The mayors asked the king so the honour would be larger. The king agreed.</li>
<li>Because of some act dating yet 12th century, the monarch of England is allowed to give any title to anybody he wants, including himself (like the title King of France). He is a sovereign ruler, guarded by Royal Navy, and he is not afraid nor doesn't care of what anybody else thinks. If you get the title &quot;Viscount of Moscow, 1st Baronet of Vatican&quot;, it is your problem to explain it to the Council of Moscow and the Pope.</li>
<li>These were honorary or ceremonial titles. No land was given for the generals. (this does not exclude other options)</li>

<li>SE gets a lot of attention and can be very helpful for tracking down sources, especially across international/language boundaries. I know of no better community to tap for these requests.</li>
<li>Philosophically speaking, what we know about the past is subject to change based on new evidence. Not to sound too extreme, but every question about history is implicitly asking for an answer based on the best available information we have today. Many things are cut-and-dry, but non-source answers are also subject to change.</li>
<li>Therefore, I think that <em>specific</em> source questions should be allowed. That is, questions that <strong>can</strong> have a definitive answer, if the information were to be available (regardless of whether or not it is).</li>

<p>You can see that the number one tag is united-states: a whopping 465 questions. This is a problem. There are 4235 questions on the site, and over 10% of them are about one country, despite the fact that this country comprises less than one-twentieth of the world's population, and its written history only goes back to the fifteenth century, that is if you count the three hundred years before it became an independent country (the history of what is now the USA before the Europeans' arrival is, of course, on a different tag). </p>

<p>Contrariwise China only has 116 tags. China's written history goes back <em>four thousand years</em>, and it's currently home to over one billion people: more than one seventh of the human population. How can it possibly be right that it has fewer questions than the USA?</p>

<p>I don't say this to disparage the USA or American contributors, nor am I saying we need fewer questions about the USA. I have asked a number of questions about the USA myself, and will continue to do so.</p>

<p>However, it is reasonable that the number of questions asked on a topic should reflect the quantity of information available about that topic. Stack Exchange is an American company, and I admit that I didn't read Stack Exchange's terms and conditions when I joined, but I'm willing to bet that <strong>American exceptionalism is not something I signed up to.</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the problem is not confined to the USA as a topic. World War 2 gets more tags than the whole of the century in which it is contained, and more than the two continents in which most of it took place. Nazi Germany, a twelve year period, gets more tags than plain old Germany, a country which has existed in some form since the Roman Empire. And yes, I have asked questions about all those things, and I don't want anyone to ask fewer questions about them, either.</p>

<p>The solution, then, entails getting <em>more</em> quality questions on under-asked topics on this stack.</p>

<p>We can do this by reputation prizes. We identify what tags need more questions. When someone asks or answers a question with e.g. a China tag, and their post has a positive score of (say) 5 or above, they get a generous bonus of rep points, in the order of 200, or more.</p>

<p>There is nothing sinister about the profile of questions revealed by the tag list which I posted. They are simply a reflection of a user-base which is mostly Anglophone, American, and probably also white, male, and univeristy educated. Once again, there is nothing wrong with any of those things, and I am all of them, except American.</p>

<p>I suggested before that we need to attract different types of questions, and to do that we need to attract different contributors, not to the exclusion of existing users but in addition to them (us).</p>

<p>Anglophone contributors, like myself, are unlikely to be able to tell us much about renaissance Germany or 18th-century China, or ask as many good questions about them. Questions and answers at this site are posted in English, so new contributors need some command of the language. However, I strongly suggest that we should be more lenient towards spelling and grammatical errors, particularly when these are likely to be the result of non-native English. How many of us would feel confident discussing history in Italian or Arabic, or even Japanese? </p>

<p>If someone makes a language error that seriously impairs our understanding of their post, we should ask for clarification. When mistakes are inconsequential, which they usually are, use editing priveleges to correct it, or just ignore it altogether.</p>

I think the last time we did a ""question of the month"", my suggestion was for ""Austronesian month"". </p>

<p>It is perhaps unfair to throw the phrase ""exceptionalisim"" around though. We can only answer the questions we get, so everything really depends on the interests of our users. Right now, nearly 50% of all internet users are North Americans. Its probably a straight majority if you throw out internet users who don't understand English. It shouldn't surprise anyone that people in general are most interested in their own country's history. So only 10% of questions about the country most of our users (likely) come from is if anything surprisingly low.</p>

<p>All this concentration in effort in a few places does serve to make them look ""exceptional"" just by the sheer weight of material. This isn't just an academic discussion either; it does real harm in the world. To riff off your WWII example, for all the talk you see about the Holocaust to the exclusion of other genocides, a lot of people have come to see it as some kind of exclusively 20th Century German problem, rather than the part of human nature that genocide is. Genocide is <em>not</em> a part of human history we should be resigned to be repeating, but that's what we doom ourselves to if we don't try to properly understand it.</p>

<p>First, as a reference to <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/898/2395"">Tyler Durden's answer</a>, for which I do not understand downvotes, actually <em>almost every</em> question is asking about references. Did something happen? In history, we can be sure only if somebody has written (or stored in other way). But this can be lie, the source can be incomplete, or the asker was not smart enough to understand relationships between two events. So that's why people ask. We require references for such questions.</p>

<p>Second, there are questions for which sources exist. If someone asks ""Who was Adolf Hitler?"", we can close it. Such question does not require big querying and probably in most languages in the world there is at least a Wikipedia page for such a topic. This is an English speaking forum, so we can assume that anyone can find an answer in English.</p>

<p>Third, in some cases, it's not that obvious. No-one is able to read all the books that people have written since the beginning of the world. If somebody asks ""Where can I find more info about Pontius Pilate?"" this is not obvious question. We know that even many Christians consider him evil, but some think he was later a saint. Which sources show neutral point of view? Which are a sort of Christian/Jewish/Roman/etc. propaganda? I think this would be an interesting question.</p>

<p>Fourth, sometimes the answer would be too long and the asker knows it. Let's assume I am interested in ""Age of Discoveries"". I'd like to read a book about it, but I'm not sure which one is worth reading. I don't have particular question now - in fact I just saw ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and liked how ships fought. But I saw some ghosts, magic, sea monsters etc. in which I don't believe. What would you suggest me? This is in my opinion a good question. I'm interested in all of the aspects, both everyday living (tools, clothes, were marriages contracted, etc.), particular topics (pirates, governors, conquistadors) but also in great events (conquest of Peru, Mexico, settlements in Virginia etc.). I know there are many sources but which one is the best?</p>

<p>Fifth, there can be questions about validity of the sources. For example ""Marcus Brittanicus wrote that Nero was visiting Hispalis, while Romus Italicus said he was only thinking about it, and Propius Helveticus said three hundred years later that it was not Hispalis but Hortonium, and then in 18th century Gibbon said that Brittanicus had never existed, which one is right?""</p>

<li>Graduation - 10 questions per day is the current threshold for consideration for graduation. For reference, we've been bouncing around between 3 and 6 for the last quarter, with a slight but noticeable upward trend.</li>
<li>Closure - As long as a stack can properly keep itself clean (handle flags and spam, enforce ""niceness"", etc.) then it won't be a candidate for closure.</li>
</ul>

<p>So it looks like we will probably remain in ""beta"" for a while, but that's not so bad. There has been some discussion on possibly renaming that state to try to remove the stigma. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>You're getting undeserved criticism; I challenged you to explain why the point wasn't trivial and you responded.  I don't think anyone should criticize you on those grounds. I understand why you think the question is non-trivial (I disagree, but respect your point of view).   There is an ongoing discussion of how to ask example questions.  I don't quite understand it but there are some example questions that seem to trigger an anti-pattern that results in what you've called ""stifling moderation"" (as good a term as any until we understand it.)</p></li>
<li><p>You and Semaphore and many others are right that we're not doing an effective job of attracting and converting new users. 
Transparency of rules will help.  That said, this is a community moderated site; if you want to change the community, you've got to engage with the community.  </p></li>
<li><p>I must respectfully disagree with your assertions between history and morality.  History is a science; I don't recognize morality as a science.  Studying history through a moral lens distorts both, confuses both and prevents reaching coherent conclusions about either.  We can look at a historical event and discuss what happened, why it happened, and what it meant to the participants. But with limited exceptions, morality takes us into a morass of conflicting definitions.   </p></li>

<p>That said, your viewpoint is not an obstacle to participation.  I don't require that others accept my economic analysis, I respect Mr. Russell even though his
perspective on labor is so alien to me as to nearly constitute a
foreign language, and we all respect Anixx's viewpoints on non-Soviet
topics.</p>

No apparent relation between history and morality : Ok, so you're saying that the proverb ""history is written by the victors"" is a figment of my own imagination and nobody else anywhere thinks so. I suspect that. There's a reason why books like ""people's history.."", ""underground history.."", subaltern history etc are out there. To ignore these existences is IMHO unscientific. There's a solid chance that the officially accepted, ""scientifically approved"" versions of history by the mainstream consensus are not everything there is to the tale, and I will assert that this is more for history than for, say, mechanics.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to get at is that if you apply the one-size-fits-all rules and ASSUME that what you have as the status quo is perfect, scientific etc and if you straightaway dismiss anything that is not backed by mainstream institutions, then you are not being neutral or scientific. You are then being biased towards the side that has written history. And that carries moral implications.</p>

<p>The study of whether a certain invasion was justified or not, pretty much depends on whether you have given equal space to all the stakeholders to provide testimony or not. And at present day it might just turn out that one of the stakeholders does NOT have sophisticated and internationally reputed institutions in their country that can properly express their side due to the invasion. Libya, Iraq are prime examples of this.</p>

<p>Noam Chomsky's writings are a great example of the moral implications of which version of history you treat as acceptable and what you don't tolerate on the grounds of it not being mainstream-backed-enough.</p>

* Probably not ephemeral; I doubt there are many new <em>serious</em> publications in the field.
* Definitely opinion based - different scholars will probably disagree on which source contains the best ratio of fact to fiction; they will probably disagree on what is fact and what is fiction.
* Probably imprecise - specific words in the question can lead to answers dealing with mentalism, spirtualism, occult practice, deaths, murders, hauntings, fairy tales, and a host of other phenomena.</p>

<p>If you can phrase your question to avoid the pitfalls, I think you can ask it here.  BUt I suspect that it will generate some meta-discussion.  </p>

<p>So here it is: does History.SE have a policy against softer questions, or against questions with more than one answer? What about questions that specifically ask for more than one answer?</p>

<p>If there is, as the mods seem to suggest, such a policy, should there be? I would say that my question provides a good use case for when such questions <em>can</em> be a useful resource, as well as a fun exercise. I'd also argue that the SE format is well suited to such questions: in particular the voting mechanism can help to sort through a large volume of decent answers, to find the few real gems.</p>

<p>This purpose is <em>not</em> served by chats or forums. Like all SE questions, the aim is to create a presistent resource, that people can add to or benefit from over a large period of time.</p>

<p>I'm not really active in this community, so I don't have strong feelings either way, but I thought I could create the meta topic at least.</p>

In general, I think the best way to resolve differences of opinion on SE sites is always going to be via votes on questions.</p>

<p>That being said, I'm afraid the issue of exactly what disciplines are considered on-topic on this stack is so fundamental that we simply cannot leave it up in the air. It causes confusion in new posters, and repetitive comment discussions and close/open fights. For instance, on <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/25980/are-malays-in-malaysia-descended-from-yunnan-china#comment64700_25980"">this recent question</a>, where a comment asking about how the user's question could be improved led to yet another rehash of <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1987/questions-concerning-non-written-history"">this meta discussion</a> in the comments (and a very confused user). The question was subsequently closed (likely by anti-prehistory people), and then reopened (likely by pro-prehistory people).</p>

<p>I believe we have come to the point where we need to make it clear, preferably on our <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">help center topicality page</a>, whether questions that necessarily must rely on non-written sources like DNA, linguistics, and oral history, are on-topic. The current situation of confusion is not good for the stack.</p>

<p>So what I'd like to do here is entertain ideas for the form of the modifications to our help center page. If you'd prefer to argue prehistory pro or con, that might be better carried out on the <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1987/questions-concerning-non-written-history"">existing meta discussion page</a>. I'd point out the current vote tally there is 5-1 pro-prehistory. However, that's literally 5 votes to 1. It really could use more votes.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What types of questions should I avoid asking?</h2>

<p><br> First, make sure that your question is on-topic for this site.</p>

<ul>
<li>Don’t ask trivial questions. Check wikipedia and google; if the answer is there, then your question is trivial and off topic.  However, if they provide an answer, but the answer is incomprehensible, please ask here, but explain why the other answers don’t make sense.  Many pages in google or wikipedia are based on assumptions that aren’t obvious, and H:SE is very good at identifying the assumptions and helping you find pointers to further reading.</li>
<li>Don’t ask chatty, open-ended questions; ask narrowly focused questions. Open ended questions diminish the usefulness of our site and push other questions off the front page. Ensure that your question has an answer, and that a reasonable person can identify the answer unambiguously.  If necessary ask several narrow questions rather than one broad one. </li>
<li>Don’t ask for a doctoral thesis; ask reasonably scoped questions. If you can imagine an entire book that answers your question, you’re asking too much.   </li>
<li>Don’t  ask for sources unless you are asking for a very specific, canonical source. “I would like a book about X” is out of scope, “I would like to know the authoritative source for Parliamentary records in during the English Republican period” is probably OK.  This is frequently discussed in meta; if you’re unsure, search for “sources” in meta and review the discussion.</li>
<li>If your motivation for asking the question is “I would like to participate in a discussion about ______”, then you should not be asking here. However, if your motivation is “I would like others to explain ______ to me”, then you are probably OK. (Discussions are of course welcome in our real time web chat.)</li>
</ul>

<p><br> To prevent your question from being flagged and possibly removed, avoid asking subjective questions where </p>

<ul>
<li>every answer is equally valid: “What’s your favorite ______?”</li>
<li>your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: “I use ______ for ______, what do you use?”</li>
<li>there is no actual problem to be solved: “I’m curious if other people feel like I do.”</li>
<li>you are asking an open-ended, hypothetical question: “What if ______ happened?”</li>
<li>your question is just a rant in disguise: “______ sucks, am I right?”</li>
</ul>

<p>(The above section was adapted from MetaFilter’s FAQ.)</p>

<p>Some subjective questions are allowed, but “subjective” does not mean “anything goes”. All subjective questions are expected to be constructive. What does that mean? Constructive subjective questions:
* inspire answers that explain “why” and “how”
* tend to have long, not short, answers
* have a constructive, fair, and impartial tone
* invite sharing experiences over opinions
* insist that opinion be backed up with facts and references
* are more than just mindless social fun
<br> For more detail, read about our guidelines for great subjective questions and blog post about how real questions have answers.
<br> If your question is about the site itself, please don't ask it here. Visit our meta-discussion site, where you can talk about things like what questions are appropriate, what tags should be used, suggest a feature, point out a bug, or generally discuss how this site works.</p>

<p>Its pretty clear that this is a question new users are just aching to ask. However, it tends to be closed as ""subjective"", I believe on the grounds that absolute blame is such a squishy issue.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I entirely agree with that, but assuming that's the community's stance, I'd like to do something to (perhaps) prevent this from getting reasked so often. I think the fact that new users come here looking for that answer, and there is no open question on it, encourages it to get re-asked.</p>

<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/813/why-was-germany-held-accountable-for-ww1"">This (first) version of the question</a> was very well-received, before it was closed. 9 votes for the question, 4 answers. Accepted answer with 17 votes. Its a rare question on this stack that does so well, frankly.</p>

<p>What I'd like to propose is that I lock that version of the question with the ""historical significance"" tag. That would prevent modification of it or new answers, and put the following note on it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question exists because it has historical significance, but it is
  not considered a good, on-topic question for this site, so please do
  not use it as evidence that you can ask similar questions here. This
  question and its answers are frozen and cannot be changed. More info:

<p>Then if (when) this particular question gets asked again, we can close the new version as a dup, which both points people to the proper answered form of the question, and informs them not to ask questions like this. </p>

<p>This is, I believe, a common problem with complex issues on this site. Many people seem to approach multifaceted controversies expecting there to be one correct answer. They look for black and white when reality contains numerous nuances and interpretations.</p>

<p>To be clear, I do not fault anyone for this. Popular conceptions of history heavily buys into a singular narrative (and usually nationalistic or ideologically motivated one). This is more readily apparent in pre-tertiary education, which no doubt shaped most people's view of history, but is also present in many popular history works. And fundamentally, I think the human simply appreciates a single clear answer better than ""its complicated"".</p>

<p>However, I do believe that this site should go above and beyond popular junk history and distill academic history into an accessible, useful, format for the average Q&amp;A seeker. <strong>To that end, I propose that next time we see this question, and questions of a similar nature, experienced users should:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Proactively edit</strong> the question to ask about historiography rather than invite opinions.</li>
<li><strong>Actively downvote</strong> and discourage answers that make no attempt to address and reference the broader historiography, i.e. the different theories provided by other historians.</li>
<li><strong>Provide good answers</strong> that at least outline the various academic views on the subject.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, ""Is Germany to blame for WW1?"" is a poor question inviting personal opinions. ""How do historians explain the outbreak of WW1, and how has academic views evolved over time? Have any consensus been reached?"" Sets the stage for a more academically rigorous answer.</p>

We have different understandings of the problem.  But there are two important points.</p>

<p>First, when I cite Schecter vs US and he cites some other work, each of us will disagree on the priority &amp; pre-eminence of the work, but we will mutually acknowledge that the other is citing a correct canonical source from their historical perspective. He may say that I'm wrong in my conclusions, but he will (probably) not disagree with the facts, just the interpretation.</p>

<p>Second, and potentially more important, history is a verb - history is a process of creating narrative from sources.  We all acknowledge that we bring different perspectives to the table. I continue to cite Mr. Russell because although his perspective is so alien that I almost need a dictionary to understand it, he is always civil and respectful, always focused on the facts, not on ad hominem.  So long as we follow his example, we can resolve differences of opinion about whether a source is canonical or not.</p>

<p>Having just barely joined History.SE after participating in several other SE communities, I've been struck with how <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1957/16083"">closed</a> the community <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1944/16083"">seems</a> to be to newcomers and casual participants - there seems to be a ""serious <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/"">academics</a> only"" sign on the clubhouse. In particular, the negative response to <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/27202/16083"">this answer sourced from a religious text</a> seems quite aggressive - it <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer"">answers the question perfectly</a>, but has been thoroughly down-voted by the community, with the most up-voted comment being that the religious source quoted is categorically <code>""not considered a reliable historical source by independent scholars""</code>. That statement applies to practically any religious text; indeed, there is <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/513/are-hadiths-useable-as-references"">a well-written question</a> on whether (specific) religious texts are acceptable sources for this community that points this out. The lone answer says, roughly, ""probably no for answers, but yes for questions [if they're worded right] because they might be interesting.""</p>

<p>Perhaps a bit of a double standard, but it makes sense given that this is a History forum, and it's consistent with what I've seen so far on the site. Since SE sites are each their own community with their own self-defined and self-enforced rules - so be it. However, I haven't found a clearly stated stance on this, in the FAQs, question guide, or Meta; <strong>I'd like to understand what the community stance is on referring to the content of religious texts as a reference,</strong> independent of claiming those texts are 'true' in the religious sense.  </p>

<h2>Observations:</h2>

<p>Browsing the site to understand community attitudes turned up other <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice"">hostile</a> exchanges on other topics, and reading other History meta questions on sources (e.g <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1/should-we-include-sources-in-answers"">Should we include sources in answers?</a>) indicates that religion has come up before. One <strong><a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/783/16083"">excellent answer</a></strong> to a meta question regarding a religious topic (itself spawned by <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10328/how-rich-were-carpenters-in-the-roman-province-of-iudaea-in-the-1st-century-ad"">aggressive treatment of a religious-themed question</a>) summed things up quite well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some topics are known to cause flamewars on the Internet. [...E]xtremely polarizing topics have a strong tendency to attract the wrong sort of audience: people who care more about the subject than they do about the study of history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The top of <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/804/16083"">religion-oriented questions</a> has come up before; but what is the stance on answers to non-religious questions that include material from a religious text? It appears to be that religious texts are rejected as primary sources, often with dismissive or sneering remarks. A few thoughts about this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Religious texts are generally unverifiable, have little or no concurrent historical material given their age, and contain controversial material that is nearly impossible to discuss objectively. Accordingly, religious texts are basically useless for the purposes of the academic historian, so I can see why they're being frowned on here.</p></li>
<li><p>Because they are not generally useful for scholarship, religious texts seems to be completely disregarded, even if they contain content relevant to the original question (as in the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/27202/16083"">answer</a> I referenced). This rejection is often quite blunt and even derisive - comments rejecting that answer use phrases like <code>""sci-fi"", ""in-universe"", ""mythology"", ""a derivative work that cites no other sources""</code> [quite an oxymoron, that one], <code>""historical fiction""</code>, and <code>""[as valid as] a Tom Clancy novel.""</code></p></li>
<li><p>My experience has been that very few scholars/historians have put much effort into researching the content, authenticity, or background of religious texts [<em>edit:</em> before rejecting them], unless they actually focus on religious history specifically. This leads to extremely divisive opinions on any given text, reinforcing the inability to use the text in ""serious"", non-religious research. This creates a feedback-loop that perpetuates the exclusion of religious texts from ""serious"" historical scholarship. ""I don't believe the source from a religious standpoint, and it doesn't have enough scholarly research to verify it, therefore there is no more reason to leave my ivory tower to do scholarly research on it than on the latest NY Times novel. QED."" <em>Based on the phrasing used, I sincerely doubt any of the downvoters/commenters on that answer have read the text in question, any impartial research on it's authenticity [beyond Wikipedia, which suffers from this same problem], or even a single apologist's work on the text - just <a href=""https://xkcd.com/978/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">self-reinforcing, mutually cross-referencing</a> dismissals of it.</em></p></li>
<li><p>The acceptance or out-of-hand rejection of religious texts as quotable sources in an answer has a lot to do with the self-definition of this community. Is this site for <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/99/our-answers-need-to-be-more-like-skeptic-ses-answers"">academia-level historic scholars only</a>? Armchair historians? Casual participants? SE sites in general are certainly not for the random drive-by Googler, but where and how does History.SE set the bar participation? <em>This is, of course, a separate topic but relevant to the discussion.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Hopefully stating some concrete criteria for referencing religious texts will allow the community to moderate them categorically without being [or pretending to be, explicitly or by inference] authorities on a given text. The <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask"">History.SE How to Ask FAQ</a> states <code>""Keep an open mind""</code> about unexpected answers, yet responses to religious texts seem to mark them as an exception to this rule.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Goal:</h2>

<p>I'm not interested in discussing the specific question or the validity of the quoted religious text here, although it's an interesting topic. <strong>I'm hoping to get answers (possibly a community wiki) that clarify the community stance on when (if ever) it is appropriate to refer to religious texts</strong>, or even community source standards in general.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>IMO it is appropriate to use religious texts as sources if they qualify as good historical sources.  If they don't you're going to need good historical sources to back up their claims.</p>

<p>Whether it's a book, a speech, a web page, a Wikipedia article, something someone said... they all undergo the same criterion to determine if they're a good historical source.</p>

<p>What those criterion might be for the community, I don't know, but I've laid my basics out below.</p>

<hr>

<p>As for whether History.SE is for historians or not, that's the wrong question.  It is for producing high quality answers.  Ideally academics and armchair historians can work together to make this happen.  I regularly suggest improvements and sources to answers with potential.  For example, if someone knew of independent verification of the Jaredites that could be added.</p>

<p>Or, another example, I misspelled ""Herodotus"" all over this answer and @Yannis quietly fixed it. :)</p>

<p>But there isn't verification. It's a low quality answer. It gets appropriately down voted and buried. This might not make you feel so good if you're attached to the answer, but it's a necessary part of maintaining high quality answers.  A good down vote comes with suggestions for improvements, like providing a better source.</p>

<p>Stick around.  I'm firmly an armchair historian, guilty on many an occasion of leaning too heavily on web pages and Wikipedia articles as sources, and I contribute plenty.</p>

<hr>

<p>For context, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/27202/4615"">this is the answer which sparked this</a> and it uses <em>The Book Of Mormon</em> (referred to as the <em>BoM</em>) as its sole reference.  It's about the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaredites"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jaredites</a> for which there is no evidence for existence.</p>

<p>One thing I'd like to point out is the comments remain very civil and on the topic of the <em>BoM</em> as a source.  A few flip comments about ""sci-fi"" aside, nobody in that comment stream started bagging on Mormonism.  It stuck to its utility as a source.</p>

<p>The <em>BoM</em> was not rejected out of hand.  Several people, including myself, gave reasons for why it's not a good source.  I judged the <em>BoM</em> with the same criterion as I would any source, religious text or not.  It is a derivative work...</p>

<ul>
<li>Written millennia after the fact (written in 1830 covering as far back as 2200 BC).</li>
<li>Written by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a non-historian</a>.

<ul>
<li>With a clear bias (founding a religion).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>His claimed sources have never been reviewed (ie. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_plates"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the golden plates</a>).

<ul>
<li>He hid his sources.</li>
<li>Claims divine guidance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Regularly contradicts accepted history.</li>
<li>Not accepted as a valid historical source by the academic community.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is, I feel, quite restrained.  It avoids the question of it being a religious text and judges it only as a historical source.  Any one of those points is bad, all five puts it solidly in the realm of historical fiction.  Blunt, yes, but necessary because it was continuously pushed as a valid source, and restricted only to it's value as a source.</p>

<p>In short, ""some guy said so"" is not good enough for History.SE, even if they wrote it down.</p>

<p>As a parallel example, consider <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/27199/4615"">another answer to that same question</a> using Herodotus' <em>Histories</em> as a source.  That's also a problem, but it's on firmer ground.  <a href=""http://harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=30"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Herodotus is not the most reliable historian</a>, but much of what he's said has been independently verified... ignoring the odd furry, gold digging giant ant.</p>

<p><em>Histories</em>, as a source, is <em>generally</em>...</p>

<ul>
<li>Written as a contemporary (or within living memory).</li>
<li>Written by historian.

<ul>
<li>...albeit the first historian, but laid out principles of objectivity.</li>
<li>...but prone to being duped (see also giant ants).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I don't actually know if Herodotus cites sources.</li>
<li>Usually conforms to known history.

<ul>
<li>Many claims have been verified by modern historians.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Accepted, with many caveats, as a valid historical source by the academic community.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Histories</em> is somewhere between <em>BoM</em> and a valid source. It can't be accepted on face value, it's claims need have been verified, and that work has already been done. Sometimes the claims pan out, sometimes they don't. In short, an answer relying solely on <em>Histories</em> should probably back it up with a firmer source.</p>

<p>Two very different texts, both controversial to historians in their own way.  Same objective criterion applied.  You get a good first order approximation.  I'm measuring The Father Of History and <em>The Book Of Mormon</em> with the same yardstick.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'd like to address points 1-5, and #3 in particular, which I sum up as ""what do we do about poorly researched sources""?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My experience has been that very few scholars/historians have put much effort into researching the content, authenticity, or background of religious texts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't believe this is true, quite the opposite, but for argument's sake let's assume it is true that the <em>BoM</em> has not received serious academic attention.  The reasons for that are out of scope for determining if something is a good source (though it might make a good question).  Regardless of the reason, your answer is still using a poorly researched source making unverified claims.</p>

<p>A source doesn't get a pass just because nobody's looked into it.</p>

<hr>

<p>I also commented that <em>""we wouldn't accept an answer out of a Tom Clancy novel either""</em>.  Now I have some more space to expand on that.</p>

<p>I've often used Tom Clancy as an example why just because <em>some</em> things are true in a story doesn't mean they're all true.  For example, if you dug up a copy of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Storm_Rising"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Red Storm Rising</em></a> 1000 years in the future you'd note that the United States and Soviet Union were real countries, NATO and the Warsaw Pact were real, the Cold War was a real thing, the military technology checks out, Tom Clancy was alive during that era... it's written by a contemporary and the setting fits with other accounts of the 20th century.  </p>

<p>But then you'd note that while the setting might be correct, the story contradicts with known history.  Nizhnevartovsk was not blown up.  The Soviets didn't invade the Middle East.  Nobody else mentions a European war in 1986.  Etc...</p>

<p>More to the point, <em>we know Red Storm Rising was fiction</em>.  In that same manner, <em>we know the BoM is fiction</em>.  We know it was published by a guy in the northeast US in 1830 who could not have known what happened thousands of years before.  In contrast with most other religious texts that are an amalgamation of stories over many years and many authors which might mix in oral histories and contemporary accounts.</p>

<p>By asking us to accept the <em>BoM</em> as history is asking us to accept ""God told me"" as a valid historical source.  This opens the door to having to accept other, contradicting, religious texts.  Not to mention ESP, mental projection, past lives, seances... and History.SE becomes AlternativeHistory.SE.</p>

<p>Telling someone their religious text is historical fiction is pretty rude, but here <em>we're being asked to judge the BoM as a historical source</em>.  So I will be fair and judge it as a historical source: the <em>BoM</em> is historical fiction.  I don't know how to cushion the blow any more and still be academically honest.</p>

<p>Hey, at least I picked a good author for the analogy. ;)</p>

<hr>

<p>A final note. Consider that you're not the first person, by a long shot, to attempt to argue that the <em>BoM</em> or other religious text should be accepted as history.  These are discussions that many of the users here have had over and over and over and over and over and over again.  So yeah, there will be a hint of frustration in having to have it yet again with a new user.</p>

<p>I hope that helps you understand both why you're going to get a dismissive tone, but also to understand how much restraint and effort the people here are going through to fully address these concerns... again.</p>

<p>(And when we're done there should be a FAQ.)</p>

<p>It occurs to me that stating <code>""we know &lt;given religious text&gt; is fiction""</code> really gets at the heart of the friction that comes up between historians and religious proponents, especially as a parallel between a religious text and a modern fictional work. There is a fundamental difference between the nature of (and personal/emotional investment in) a work specifically written &amp; acknowledged as entertainment, and one viewed as having religious meaning. I fully understand the point of the comparison as ""can't accept as a basis for discussion on secular history"" but it strongly implies ""historians know your sacred text is a lie and you're an idiot."" Whether historians actually believe that about the religious or not, it's an abrasive way to put it (as acknowledged). I hope any FAQ article is worded more diplomatically. :)</p>

<p>By its very nature in discussing ideas or non-transferable experiences outside document-able or common human experience, religion <em>cannot</em> be understood or discussed in the same framework as recorded history. The fact that much of surviving history is tied so closely to religion makes this a difficult topic; it's really only in the last few centuries that science has been viewed as having meaning without religion, so historical documents are riddled with religion and vice versa. The scientific method &amp; its results have pretty much replaced religion for many people as the source of truth in modern times though. Again, no debate here about whether that's good or naive or whatever, just stating the dichotomy that they are not viewed as compatible - the framework of the discussion is entirely different.</p>

<p>The Question is about <strong>community criteria for referencing religious sources</strong>.
I assert:</p>

<ul>
<li>If there is such a criteria, it is not clearly articulated. </li>
<li>The site would be stronger if such a criteria were articulated clearly.</li>
<li>Everyone accepts that all historical sources have intrinsic bias. </li>
</ul>

<p>I further suggest that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Religious sources can be cited as evidence that the author of the source felt/believed/perceived the statement to be true.</li>
<li>The authorship of a religious source (and the concomitant analysis of bias) is the person who transcribed the source. For example, and with all due respect to the traditions involved, although it is my understanding that Allah dictated the Quran to Mohamed,  <strong>for the purposes of historical research,</strong> we will treat Mohammed as the author.  <strong>For the purposes of historical research</strong> we will treat the author of the Golden Tablets as Joseph Smith.</li>
</ul>

<p>Analysis of a historical source requires research and understanding of the source's context and reference framework.  I do not believe that it is responsible for me to analyze the context and reference framework of either Allah or the Angel Moronai.  I can however research and understand the context of either Mohammed or Joseph Smith.  </p>

<p>Speaking only for myself, I do not feel that it is appropriately respectful for me to analyze and discuss either Allah or Moronai. My reluctance to discuss their involvement in these works is not an attempt to argue any point, but instead a desire to ensure that my discussion stays within a shared context. I recognize that co-religionists who share a context and reference frame can conduct analysis of those sources that benefit from the shared context, but since I don't share that context, I won't pretend that I am competent where I am not.</p>

<p>Repeating for emphasis; I respect both traditions, I intend no insult to either. I am using those traditions as examples only because I have friends who profess those traditions, and I hope that my respect for my friends will ensure that I am respectful to the respective traditions</p>

<p>What I would encourage is everyone (myself included) to at least make more of an effort to follow the little reference notes Wikipedia puts in its text, and use those instead of the actual Wikipedia text. Among other reasons, Wikipedia text can change drastically as time goes by, whereas the sources should not. I can tell you from experience that fixing a years-old answer you hardly remember writing when its link is no longer any good is a real drag.</p>

<p>That being said, Wikipedia is all about condensing said sources into a short, coherent narrative on the subject (of the page) accessible to non-experts. The overlap between that and what needs to be done in an answer here is so great, that very often Wikipedia is far and away the best source I can provide. I'll follow the source links there, but very often they don't tell enough of the story, or far far too much of some other story to wade through to get the one relevant nugget of info, or both such that even seeing that nugget requires knowledge that a novice may not have. This would require me to duplicate a lot of the glue text that the Wikipedia article provided. Doing that would be a duplication of effort, cause insanely boring expansions of my answer, and IMHO be morally questionable. </p>

<p>So I think there are many situations where a Wikipedia link allows me to give a short coherent answer, at the expense of being twice removed from the sources rather than just once. But at least this has the advantage that the reader has multiple layers of detail through which they can chose to dive.</p>

<p>Reading back through this, its coming off as an unmitigated defense of ""Sola Wikipedia"" answers, and I don't intend that. I agree with the question that we have a problem with those.

<p>Having said that, I don't understand the problem.   Why are answers referencing Wikipedia intrinsically bad?</p>

<p>The vote up/vote down mechanism provides you the option to discourage answers that you think are too reliant on wikipedia...</p>

<p>Most of us don't have access to primary sources and don't have the skills needed to deal with primary sources. I suspect that the vast majority(90%+) of the questions should not be answered by primary sources. </p>

<p>Most questions aren't really complex enough to merit either primary or secondary sources.  (Aside: I think that the answers with no references are far more dangerous to the site than those with wikipedia references.  While the GodKing of H:SE can write an essay and cite himself as the only source required, others have begun to copy this practice and just type in assertions with no evidence or references.  Many of these, including the GodKing are full of opinions and prejudices that actively interfere with meaningful historical research.  (The side effect of prohibiting primary research is that it also prohibits assertions like ""PTSD is cowardice"". )</p>

<p>T.E.D suggests that you're actually complaining about lazy answers; I'd argue that the bulk of our problem is actually lazy questions. People who don't bother to do any preliminary research.  The second largest category of our questions (assertion without evidence) is people who lack a critical bit of context to enable them to do their own research.  Once someone can point out the relevant search terms or assumptions, wikipedia is perfectly adequate to direct them to a basic article and then wikipedia references secondary sources that can be followed for further research. I've used this multiple times in my answers, citing Wikipedia for the general concepts and then following through the references that are most valuable.  </p>

<p>Wikipedia is the generic food of source material.  It is adequate for most general uses.  I think it would be a crying shame if we stopped answering questions because we couldn't answer with a primary source reference.  </p>

<p>If I look at the five most recent questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/27478/1401"">How many warriors (troops) did feudal vassals have to provide to the king?</a> - there is no value in consulting primary sources for that question.  You'd have to provide citations to hundreds of sources before you could begin to answer the question. Wikipedia will provide limited value, although perhaps the article on Feudalism might be helpful to OP.  The question contains a huge flawed assumption about uniformity and models of historical behavior.  The question is best answered by a brief essay (or closure).</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/27481/1401"">How does the US main battle rifle, the m4a1, stack up against other western main battle rifles?</a> Another question that might be best closed.  We could cite primary sources  - probably the US Army comparison and evaluation reports (Analysis of Alternatives in my field; I'm sure the Army has a different name for the reports). These are likely to be far too technical to be of general use, and to really answer the question you're going to have to pull similar reports from other armies.  The easy part is the ""when will it be replaced?"" - That answer is probably in the document.  Wikipedia may have a page on infantry weapons that is probably more closely matched to OP's request. </p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/27476/1401"">What divided the Roman Catholic church from the Russian Orthodox church of Russia?</a>  If you have to ask that question, then primary sources will not help you. Primary sources for this question are going to require so much contextual support that a secondary source is better served.

I think it's the opposite: <strong>history mostly deals with ""why""</strong>, supported by evidence from ""what"". The problem is that history deals with a specific subset of ""why""; we need to be careful when dealing with a ""why"" question, but it doesn't mean we should rule them out immediately.</p>

<p>Imagine a young child asking a series of ""why"" questions. At first the answers are trivial, but eventually they get so hard as to be unanswerable. Good history questions are like those in the middle; on one end they are trivially answered by Wikipedia, on the other they veer into social science or philosophy. <strong>We have close reasons for them already.</strong></p>

<p>Many historical sources and professional historians deal with ""why""s directly. For example, <em>Records of the Three Kingdoms</em> contains this appraisal of Guan Yu: <code>然羽剛而自矜，飛暴而無恩，以短取敗，理數之常也。</code> That is, ""Guan Yu's defeat was due to his arrogance."" If someone were to ask ""Why was Guan Yu defeated in Fancheng?"" then there's a direct answer from a historical source.</p>

<p>What I'm proposing is that <strong>we go easier on ""why"" questions.</strong> We're already quite tough on newbies; this is understandable as it's a defense against the disproportionate amount of crackpots and amateurs we attract (guilty myself, but I'm trying to learn!) but please don't knee-jerk react when you see ""why"" in the question. A lot of these questions attract really poor answers, but I think we should <strong>blame the bad answers, not the question.</strong> Look at that close reason again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many good questions generate <strong>some degree of opinion based on expert experience</strong>, but answers to this question will tend to be almost entirely based on opinions, rather than facts, references, or specific expertise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's focus on that first part, and for us this means:</p>

<ul>
<li>Good answers are supported by good historical sources</li>
<li>Good answers cite the opinions of professional historians, and don't rely on personal speculation</li>
</ul>

<p>So before you close a question using that reason, consider: do you really know the topic well, and know that there are no historical sources that address the question? Sometimes it's hard to tell a good ""why"" question from a bad one. Don't conclude that it's a bad one just because it's currently attracting bad answers - we have other tools for that, like the ""protect"" function. If you're not sure, give it a chance.</p>

<a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/25921/1401"">How and when was Portugal created?</a>
As I said in my comments, this question is really frustrating because the original poster asserted that he did research and consulted wikipedia, but didn't get an answer.  He didn't provide any links, so we don't know if he consulted the English wikipedia page on Portugal or some other page.  So if I want to try to answer this, I have to start by repeating his research.</p>

<p>Then I have to figure out why there is confusion - when I do a google search on the foundation of Portugal, I get a clear unambiguous answer. So why is there a problem?  For every other country there is a clear foundation date. Why is Portugal unique? Why didn't OP's research resolve the question?  I don't know because OP didn't share that information with me.</p>

<p>I gave up - I'm not going to answer that question because I don't want to fight up that hill to understand the question before I find the answer.</p>

<p>History is unusual (perhaps unique) because we are about research.  There is a common body of math facts that are accepted and documented, and a common body of procedures that transform those facts to new facts.  In the Project Management Stack exchange there is a Project Management Body of Knowledge (and a few other canonical references) - we can all refer to the same body of knowledge.  </p>

<p>But history is about assembling a narrative from a set of sources.  It is vital to know what sources are being consulted.  It is critical to know what assumptions the question is making.  Many of our very good questions clarify assumptions  -for example the recent question about guards wearing plate mail assumes that during the period in question there are guards and they wear armor. I think both of those assumptions are wrong.  That person will never get a good answer from wikipedia or google because they are searching with flawed assumptions.</p>

<p>You are 100% correct that it is difficult to get a question into this stack and you are (unfortunately) also correct that we could be more welcoming. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@C.M.Weimer I took a look at the exchange too. They have a point about saying things like ""It is commonly known"" without backing it up. But at most that's only reason to downvote a question. And if they are able to leave comments to the effect of ""the Greeks didn't forcibly convert people, and neither did the Romans,"" what's stopping them from writing an answer? Of course they didn't cite any sources in those comments, so I don't know if they can actually answer this question. I honestly can't understand why they closed it. – Hamlet 3 hours ago</p>
  
  <p>It was downvoted because you made a surprising claim that sounds very wrong, and yet called it ""commonly known"". It was closed because you wrote ""forced conversion"" in the title, and but talked about ""missionaries"" in the text, which is prima facie contradictory. People weren't sure which you meant, as the comments noted. It would have helped if you edited to clarify. – Semaphore♦ 3 hours ago</p>
  
  <p>@Semaphore those questions are very similar/related. An answer could have just said ""the Greeks did/didn't use missionaries, and/but they did/didn't forcibly convert people."" It's not as if OP is asking ""did the Greeks use Missionaries, and what were their naval tactics like?"" – Hamlet 2 hours ago</p>
  
  <p>@Hamlet I gave an explanation for how History.SE works. I'm not going to debate another stack's practices with you on Myth.SE, especially not off Meta. – Semaphore♦ 2 hours ago </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two points:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If Semaphore is correct as to why the question was closed, then that is probably one of the most absurd reasons for closing a question that I have ever heard of.</p></li>
<li><p>Looking through the comments on the question again, <s>I can't find a single instance where someone explained why the question was closed</s> I was able to find a comment explaining the reason, but it was buried under a lot of stuff, and it wasn't clear from reading the comment that said reason was the reason why the question was closed. I'm not quite sure how OP was expected to find it. If you're going to use an absurd reason to close a question, at least explain said reason.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In general, I haven't been very impressed with History SE. Admittedly, I don't spend much time on the site. But the quality of answers on this site seems very poor. I've seen a lot of highly upvoted answers that are inaccurate or just plain wrong. Watching this whole exchange play out seems to verify my initial impression of this site.</p>

<p>To be clear, I think you all did the correct thing in downvoting the question. It was poorly written and poorly researched. But I can't for the life of me understand why the question was closed.</p>

I did not notice the ""accepted answers"" we are discussing (I do not read all answers to all questions), and I would like to see them.</p>

<p>But I did notice several QUESTIONS
which constitute Nazi propaganda. I cannot give an example because the questions of this sort that I know have been removed, but I can explain how a question can constitute a propaganda.
A question may contain ""implicit assumptions"" (in fact many questions do). Examples (not from this site):</p>

<p>Are you still beating your wife?</p>

<p>Why is the Moon made of green cheese?</p>

<p>Such implicit assumptions may constitute propaganda. I hope everyone understands what I mean.</p>

<p>Now how should we fight this. First of all, by voting down. I suppose an accepted answer can be voted down. Is it reasonable to empower the administrators to remove some answers? Even those accepted? If there is a sufficient number of downvotes and tags. I think this is reasonable.</p>

<p>Administrators should not decide themselves what constitutes propaganda and what is not. We should be relying on votes and tags.</p>

<p>Now why should we single out Nazi propaganda/antisemitism? Or right-wing propaganda? I understand it is most obnoxious, because it is related to the hudge mass murder in the recent past.
But left-wing propaganda can be also obnoxious. I do not want to give examples,
(read political articles of people like Noam Chomsky yourself, if you want examples). And it can be neither left nor right. (Example: Russian state-sponsored ""news"" about the recent events in Ukraine which flood the media).</p>

<p>For these reasons I propose to introduce a reason for closing vote ""political propaganda"", and a corresponding tag for the answers. Questions and answers which collect certain number of these tags are closed and removed by the administrators. We can leave to the administrators to decide how many are needed in each case. This should apply even to the accepted answers. </p>

<p>EDIT. I react on the references in the comment of Marakai. The author of the ""answer"" in the first reference is the same whom I already mentioned. His two ""propaganda questions"" in the similar style were deleted. I already proposed to ban this user. And I repeat my proposal: after all, this is a third offence, and I hope the moderators have access to his deleted ""questions"". This ""answer"" is not accepted, and was downvoted many times. This case seems to be clear.</p>

<p>The case of the second reference is more complicated. Superficially it looks like a well researched answer, and has many up votes. But it actually contains a lot of incorrect statements, of course without citing any source, which are skilfully mixed with correct ones. In this case I expect some person with good knowledge of the subject to refute this answer. </p>

<p>I am not <em>formally</em> a student of history, so I don't know how the historians decide which questions are objectively answerable (which seems to be the core philosophy of our SE). But sometimes I think the rules for on-topic-ness of our community are too restrictive for its own good. </p>

<p>Other sites (such as <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com"">Math.SE</a>, <a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/"">Theoretical CS.SE</a>) allow a broad array of <em>soft questions</em> (examples <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/323334/what-was-the-first-bit-of-mathematics-that-made-you-realize-that-math-is-beautif"">1</a>, <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/44704/how-to-study-math-to-really-understand-it-and-have-a-healthy-lifestyle-with-free"">2</a>, <a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1168/what-papers-should-everyone-read"">3</a>, <a href=""https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/20894/interesting-results-in-tcs-which-are-easily-explainable-to-programmers-without-t"">4</a> — they're very easy to find because many SEs have a dedicated tag called <em>soft-question</em>), which can be a little subjective, and yet manage abiding to the core philosophy of SE, i.e. not getting converted into a discussion forum.

<h1> A. Proposal for reference questions</h1>

<ol>
<li>Reference questions are now permitted. The community will be relatively conservative about duplication - we want 1 reference question/topic, we do not want lots of closely related references.  We acknowledge that there is an intrinsic problem with the scope of questions and will rely on moderation to converge. (However, B3 below may address this issue).  NOTE: This does not imply pre-emptive questions. This merely grants people who are interested to ask questions like, ""What are some sources to permit me to research X?"".</li>
<li>Anyone can ask a reference question and site will rely on moderation to  converge reference questions towards a loose standard.</li>
<li>Reference questions will have a distinctive tag (probably ""reference question"")</li>
<li>Reference questions will be community wiki so that anyone can edit. </li>
<li>Nobody makes the final call and nobody selects which questions; or to put it another way, the community moderates the site, like all other questions. I would suggest that as a community standard we be very liberal and accepting of reference requests. </li>
</ol>

<h3> B. Potential additions or alternatives</h3>

<ol>
<li>We don't do reference questions - we permit the tag wiki to contain a list of references for that tag.  @called2voyage expresses a concern that tag wiki's may not drive enough traffic to make the result reliable.  I'm not sure I understand the concern; the proposal would be better than the current reference system for H:SE. I'm not sure I understand the relationship between traffic and reliability (at the core, the problem may be that I don't understand how the term ""reliability"" is being used).   In any case, I feel that I should amplify that I suggest the tag wiki because it seems to me to be the most intuitive place to look for resources, and it re-uses existing mechanisms. It requires minimal cultural adoption, and it scales well.  I don't think that any of the potential solutions will be ""reliable"" and I don't anticipate any of them being high traffic.  </li>
<li>In order to avoid debate/discussion, reference questions will have one answer that contains a list of all the canonical or commonly approved sources.  Other answers can contain proposed resources. Any source that achieves a minimum score will be added to the canonical.  This makes the debate explicit - up &amp; down votes can be used to identify higher quality resources which are then moved to the ""accepted"" list. <em>NOTE: this seems to have support and will probably be moved to A - the only reason I'm not moving it now is that it will break the references in comments.</em></li>
<li>Every reference question should have precisely two tags - the ""reference question"" tag and a topic tag.  All references must be tightly relevant to that tag.</li>
<li>We don't delete answers with deprecated references - we annotate the answer with the reason why.  (I don't remember which eminent computer scientist ?(Allan Kay?) suggested that the best reference for every topic is ""Alice in Wonderland"".  That is great for humor, but lousy for a source question. We need a way to control both well meaning disagreement, and references with an agenda). (OP asked about how this would be policed; this is my answer, but I invite better answers.</li>
</ol>

<h3> C. Commentary</h3>

<p>I remain confused about ""select"" in the question title and the phrase ""small number"" in the question body. I haven't seen a practical suggestion to make this a select list - every proposal I see is unbounded (with the exception of a time throttle). I'm hanging a lampshade on that problem and inviting others to address the issue. (might be that it has been addressed and I just don't understand the subtlety)</p>

""Nazi Germany"" is a well understood term to describe an important period in German history under the Nazis.

What has been is people coming in with an agenda to cause confusion, those are quickly downvoted and/or deleted. This is a general problem with any controversial historical topics.</p>

<p>As to the proposed tags, they are not synonyms.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>nazi</code> or <code>National-Socialism</code> can be from any period and not specific to Germany.</li>
<li><code>historic-germany</code> spans the entire history of Germany.</li>

<ol>
<li>(Good) Its consistently getting more than 10 questions a day.</li>
<li>(Bad) Its not producing consistently helpful content, and its community isn't strong enough to perform the self-moderation function a healthy stack requires.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the first case, this is what will generally get a site <em>considered</em> for promotion out of beta. We simply aren't there. A quick check shows me we had 8 new questions posted in the last 24 hours, which is a fairly good day for us. Not a barn-burner, but probably better than average. Using my super mod powers, I'm not supposed to give detailed specifics, but I think I can fairly say we've been bumping around above and below the 5-per-day line for years.</p>

<p>In the second case, this is what will get a site closed. Again we have spurts, but I don't think we're anywhere near that level of problem. I'm not empowered with these decisions, but I think we have a very good community here. We mods may slack a bit on occasion on flag handling, but the community seems to be doing a great job of taking care of problematic questions and answers all on its own even when we don't.</p>

<p>So that leaves us in the middle. Despite what the name may lead you to believe, there's no reason why a stack couldn't stay ""beta"" forever, if that's where it belongs.

One of those meanings, in fact I'd say the <strong>predominant</strong> meaning among us computer software types, is the actual set of glyphs a language's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">writing system</a> uses. For example, must English writers use the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Latin Script</a>. That seems to be mostly the sense in which our users are using <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/script"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;script&#39;"" rel=""tag"">script</a>. </p>

<p>Its a very useful term, because not every writing system uses an ""Alphabet"". Chinese most notably is a logogram-based system. The word ""script"" covers both.</p>

<p>Looking through what we have for that tag, it indeed mostly seems to be used for questions about the historical mechanics of writing. For example questions about glyphs used for specific old languages. Only one of the six is actually a question about the meaning of the information in an old work. Such a question would certainly be on-topic here though.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now looking through your proposal, I'm not sure how much of a match you'd call that. It seems to me you are shooting for questions about interpreting the information in old documents, but to me its very confusing. The next two most common meanings of the word ""script"" I'm familiar with are (in order) </p>

<ol>
<li>The ordered set of lines and direction used to plan out a play, TV show, movie, or similar performance work.</li>
<li>An abbreviation for manuscript. Typically this means an unedited draft of a written work. However, sometimes <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Manuscript</a> is used to mean a hand-written work.</li>
</ol>

<p>If someone was talking specifically about old writings, I'd expect to see the term ""ancient manuscript"". If I see ""script"", an ancient manuscript would be pretty low on my mental rolodex of things the writer could be referring to.</p>

<hr>

<p>As a third meta-criticism:</p>

<p>I'm not saying this is what you are doing, (because frankly I don't understand your proposed domain right now), but I'd advise anyone creating a proposal that's essentially a proper subset of this stack to be realistic about what you are getting into. </p>

<p>We average about 5 questions a day here. That's not horrible, but its still ""beta"" level. You shouldn't expect to get more than that with a subset of our domain, and will likely get a fair bit less. For example, <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/65204/history-of-science-and-mathematics"">HSM</a> and <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/58307/mythology"">Mythology</a> both are running at less than one question a day now.</p>

<p>A smarter idea would be to wait until this stack is out of beta, and has additional traffic heavy enough to justify splitting off part of its domain into another healthy stack.</p>

<p>Specifically of course I'm referring to Holocaust Denialism.  Wikipedia defines Holocaust Denalism as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scholars use the term ""denial"" to describe the views and methodology of Holocaust deniers in order to distinguish them from legitimate historical revisionists, who challenge orthodox interpretations of history using established historical methodologies.[5] Holocaust deniers generally do not accept the term denial as an appropriate description of their activities, and use the term revisionism instead.[6] The methodologies of Holocaust deniers are often based on a predetermined conclusion that ignores overwhelming historical evidence to the contrary.[7] <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_denial"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That pretty well summarizes the distinction I'm trying to make.  I'm happy to discuss challenges to historical orthodoxies <em>based on historical methodologies</em>, but I don't want to engage in discussion/debate with those who are arguing from a predetermined conclusion.  </p>

<p>I believe that community moderation is sufficient to resolve any ambiguity.  I'm more comfortable with a downvote/closevote if I can point to a clearly documented community standard that we don't want to engage denialists.</p>

<p>You say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Specifically of course I'm referring to Holocaust Denialism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see nothing about the Holocaust in particular that is a problem aside from the fact that it is a sensitive topic. Yes, we should make sure the topic is handled sensitively, and we should close poor questions, but good questions about the Holocaust should be on topic.</p>

<p>You say (quoting Wikipedia):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The methodologies of Holocaust deniers are often based on a predetermined conclusion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such methodologies should not be accepted in the body of a question, but fortunately questions can be edited if there is anything salvageable. It may mean that no answer gets accepted, but that is a common problem.</p>

<p>You say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't want to engage in discussion/debate with those who are arguing from a predetermined conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, discussion/debate is already not the proper form for this site anyway. Questions that encourage such should be edited to be less discussion-inciting. If the comments end up that way anyway, moderators can step in, as they should.</p>

<p>You say:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Downvotes do not have to be based on standards, and questions should not necessarily be closed because of them.</p>

<p>Closevotes are a little different, but they are still ultimately based on one person's interpretation of the rules. I don't think we should set denialism in stone as a discouraged topic. If an otherwise good question gets closed just because of the point of view of the asker, then hopefully others will reopen.</p>

<ol>
<li>The question</li>
<li>A (failed) attempt to answer your own question.</li>
</ol>

<p>The failed attempt indicates that you have put some effort into solving the problem yourself, doing some initial research, and are stumped. For Mathematica (and I assume other SE programming sites), it works very well.</p>

<p>Do we try to do that here? Quite often, there are questions where no research, not even a cursory look into Wikipedia have been performed. These questions are irritating; I think they should definitely be closed.</p>

<p>However, take as an example <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/33024/bureaucratic-structure-of-the-state-during-the-ottoman-empire"">Bureaucratic structure of the state during the Ottoman Empire</a> which has been recommended for closure. The OP starts with what I find to be a decent question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To what extent did the bureaucratic structure of the state that were required to sustain the Ottoman’s wealth and power undermine (damage or weaken) the foundations of the Ottoman state in the late 19th and 20th centuries?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer to this question will relate to the technical advances in political administration and cultural comparison. Both of which are interesting (at least to me) when comparing the Ottoman administrative techniques to those of contemporary western Europe.</p>

<p>Then the OP takes a stab at answering the question. A quick read through their theory shows that the OP doesn't know enough historiography to take a stab creating a quality answer. It would be very difficult for the OP, without a few years of reading, to find the answer. So the OP has done some basic research, and then came to SE History to ask us, ""the experts"" for help.</p>

<p>One of the comments by @MarkC.Wallace then asks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are you advancing a theory and asking for proof, or are you asking for the answer to a question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically, this comment indicates a preference for no effort put forth by the OP? In my opinion, it seems like there is a catch 22 for new SE History members: </p>

<ol>
<li>Need to show some basic effort</li>
<li>However, don't put forth evidence that you've put in some effort, or your question will be rejected as pushing a pet theory.</li>
</ol>

<p>This might mean that we have a poorly defined standard for good questions. To be honest, after a few months here, I haven't quite figured it out. </p>

<p>Should something be done about this? </p>

<p>Part of me wishes it was standard for each question to have part A) the Question, in bold, then part B) Initial research and clarification about the question's topic. That way, we won't send away newbies who are willing to do some initial research, and put up a stronger shield against those who do no research at all.</p>

<p>However, I am relatively new here so I don't know. I think an authoritative example question might help us increase the user base, and make moderation more straightforward.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Please Note: Just to be clear, it is obvious that Mark Wallace has been working to improve the quality of questions asked here, and I want to support this thrust. I think standardization will help.</p>

<p>No. History SE is not Mathematics SE where questions (I believe close to 100%) can be answered definitively as long as they are well-asked with the OP's own research and failed attempt. Topics and the way of asking on history could vary and range from some trivias to very complicated issues that an OP might not be able to attempt to solve in the first place.</p>

<p>I don't think History SE's standard for good questions has more to do with the quality of a question than the OP's attitude and sincerity to get an answer from total strangers on the internet. The OP of the linked question should have responded to helpful comments, obviously he didn't. Why not? </p>

<p>There are many questions that have just been asked out of curiosity or boredom without any research efforts or reference. I strongly doubt any standard improvement of History SE could make those OPs change their attitude. They just post whatever they want without thinking so seriously about it and go as if nothing had happened. Look at the OP's another question. I voted to close it as it reads unclear or too broad. </p>

<p>In order for the improved standard of History SE, if any, could work in the future, those OPs should change their behavior. Do I expect them to change it? No. I don't. They will either (1) get tired and leave History SE or (2) improve their questions and stay. I have seen No. (1) far more than No. (2) not only on History SE, but also on other sites. </p>

<li>Example: <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/33140/1401"">Why was the Spanish fascist dictatorship left in power after WWII</a> - While I have reservations about this question, the title makes it clear what OP wants to know.  There are many good clear example, I selected this one because OP's question is complex and subtle.  </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Provides attribution for every non-trivial assertion - The question is predicated on rumor or on counterfactuals, or is based on belief, not evidence. 30 years after my mother stopped smoking, she still believes that smoking is healthy; if she asked a question that began, ""Since smoking has been proven to be beneficial for the lungs....."", no matter what follows, that is going to be a bad question.

<li>Counterexample: <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/33094/1401"">What is the largest mutiny in human history</a>. This question is actually a counterexample and an example.

<li>Demonstrate preliminary research - Just like it says in [ask], H:SE supplements google &amp; wikipedia, it doesn't replace them.  When you ask a question, you're asking me to put forth effort on your behalf.  Please don't ask me to google things for you or to look it up in wikipedia.  If I am in doubt, I copy the question and paste it into google; if I find the answer in the top five results, I vote to close the question as trivial. It is trivial to defend yourself against this downvote/vote to close - simply insert into the question some evidence that you did a search but the results were not satisfactory. 

<ul>
<li>Example <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/33124/1401"">Where can I find clean maps of colonial America?</a> - not a perfect example, but OP indicated that he had searched and found only contemporary maps, which is not what he wanted. </li>
<li>Example <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/11346/1401"">Who created the Korean Unification flag?</a> - OP references the relevant wikipedia pages, but is looking for specific information beyond what Wikipedia provides.</li>
<li>Counterexample <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/33149/1401"">Did CIA actually play a role in altering the end result of 1971 Indo-Pak war?</a> This question shows no research. It alludes to conflicts and events that are not supported by even the thinnest reference to wikipedia. It also refers to KGB information that is not presented or referenced. I am strongly disinclined to do research on this question, because OP is making me do all the work.  OP provides numbers and facts that indicate that OP (probably) has a reference open in another tab - but doesn't provide any citation for that reference material.  So OP is either making the data up wholecloth, or concealing from me the preliminary research.  Then OP cites a KGB source; all sources require context; intelligence sources in particular reflect sources, methods and political agendas.  It would take me significant research just to get to the point where OP starts the question; my time is more valuable than that.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ensure there is the possibility of an authoritative answer.  Meta contains multiple discussions of the advisability of list questions.  It should always be possible to identify the answer to an H:SE question, and for everyone to understand why that answer is selected as the answer. <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/users/2140/aaron-kurtzhals"">Aaron Kurthzals</a>  suggested that H:SE questions should always have an authoritative answer.   ""Give me a list of the rulers of England"" is a list question (and trivial). ""Give me a list of the Plantagenet rulers of England"" can probably be answered authoritatively.  - everyone who researches that question will come up with an answer that is at least 80% similar (I haven't done the research, so I don't recall how many edge cases there are.). An authoritative answers is one that is difficult to challenge - that means it is supported by research (not just opinion) and that most reasonable (non-fringe) researchers would come up with the same answer.</li>

<hr>

<p>The Question:</p>

<p><strong>To what extent did the bureaucratic structure of the state that were required to sustain the Ottoman’s wealth and power undermine the foundations of the Ottoman state in the late 19th and 20th centuries?</strong></p>

<p>Background:</p>

<p>The Ottoman Empire was a huge, long lasting empire. It lasted more than 400 years, and ruled over a large, diverse population. Its system of administration was simple: different ethnic groups were given a high level of autonomy if they paid taxes and acknowledged the Ottomans as the ruling power. This formula meant the more the Ottomans invaded and controlled their neighbors, the stronger they got.</p>

<p>However, in the 1800's, the Ottoman Empire lost land, population and power to Western European entities like France and England. The bureaucracy that worked so well in 1500 wasn't effective in the 1800's and 1900s.</p>

<p>Initial Research:</p>

<p>As I asked in my question, I want to know how much the structure of the Ottoman empire is responsible for its own downfall. I started by reading the Wikipedia page <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_and_modernization_of_the_Ottoman_Empire"" rel=""nofollow"">Decline and Modernization of the Ottoman Empire</a>, and it speaks about the rise of nationalism and the failure of the Tanzimat reforms. However, I can't figure out to what extend the problems were caused by the Ottoman bureacracy, or if these problems were largely caused by other issues, for example foreign intervention or economic problem.</p>

<hr>

<hr>

<p>I think it is nice to have the question in one spot, a background to explain the basics of the question and perhaps why it is being asked, and a section speaking about what the OP found in Wikipedia, and why it was unable to answer the question.</p>

  <p><strong>Caching. And some complicated eligibility rules.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Most of the time, <strong>the top bar will indicate what's still TO DO for
  the site, while the numbers under /review will indicate what's still
  TO DO for you</strong>. But when reviews are being done quickly, they can
  become out-of-date briefly. The <strong>system recalculates them every few
  minutes, so generally they won't be out of date for too long</strong>...</p>
  
  <p>...But there are still some edge-cases where <strong>there'll be items in a
  queue that you aren't eligible to review but which are disqualified
  because of tests too expensive for the system to run until/unless you
  actually try to review them</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>It's unlikely you'll encounter the latter very often, but if you see a
  discrepancy hanging around for more than 5-10 minutes, chances are
  that's what it is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what happened is, the topbar showed that a review was pending for the site to do. When you clicked it, System calculated your eligibility for the review and found out that you are not eligible for that review (Because it's your edit after all). So it showed you no pending edits. </p>

<p>Yes, posters are expected to check Google and Wikipedia before submitting questions. Questions that can be answered by Wikipedia or Google are likely to be closed as trivial.</p>
<p>@Thunderforge points out that there are a class of questions where OP may not know what to search for. <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/33860/1401"">Why is the US Independent in 1776 but the first President isn't inaugurated until 1789?</a> is (IMO) such a question; answering the question relies on knowing a specific concept (The Articles of Confederation).  If you don't have that concept, it will be difficult to interpret the results of the google search.</p>
<p>Before I vote to close any question as trivial, I copy and paste the question into google. If the answer is clear in the first five results (discounting results from H:SE), then I'll vote to close as trivial.  If, as in the case above, the answer is present, but cannot be understood without some missing knowledge, then the question is non-trivial and it is worth submitting an answer that interprets the results in the context of the missing knowledge.</p>

<p>In general I will say that we get <em>at least our share</em> of problem users. There is a process for dealing with them, the front end of which is driven by flags from users (associated downvotes and close votes help to drive home the point as well). If a user is consistently getting a lot of those for a specific type of action, they are supposed to get a <strong>warning</strong> from the moderators, and if they persist in the same behavior, a short suspension. Subsequent infractions for the same thing result in longer suspensions. We have at least one user who ""tested"" this process to such an extent that he is now suspended for more than a decade.</p>

<p>However, the root of this process is user flags. That means there may be a lot of time that passes, and a lot of flags raised, before a persistent problem user is supsended for a long period of time. The shorter suspensions before that, you might not even notice. This leads to a lot of user frustration, before the process finally reaches fruition (or the user decides to straighten up and fly right).</p>

<p>I would ask in the meantime, please try not to be vindictive about it. I try to stop to analyze every flag I process, and it takes me much more time to do so if the user is getting flagged capriciously for comments that wouldn't be a problem coming from anybody else. I do get that you are frustrated. Not because I'm some super empathetic person, but because you aren't the only one, and I get to read all the frustrated comments on flags, chat, and meta. </p>

<p>This was recently edited because the editor believed that ""The Ecole Polytechnique does not aim anymore to train officers. The Ecole Spéciale Militaire de Saint Cyr is the one responsible for it."" and the original text was replaced with the new institution.

<p>Why is this post being downvoted? I understand that it may imply a ""list"" type answer which may be difficult to determine an authoritative ""best"" answer.</p>

<p>However I feel that authoritative answers are possible: for example maybe someone or some group has put together an authoritative textbook on the topic or a widely recognised review article. Should I rephrase the question to ask ""what are authoritative sources on this topic?"" But then will someone argue that this simply leads to listing as well?</p>

<p>Further, posts such as </p>

<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/11785/what-are-the-earliest-examples-in-history-where-one-state-people-stepped-in-to-r?rq=1"">What are the earliest examples in history where one state/people stepped in to rescue another?</a></p>

<p>All give rise to possible ""list"" answers, but are upvoted extensively and I think we all agree add important content to the site, while not deviating too far from what's expected. </p>

<p>There is also precedent on other sites for questions that don't necessarily have authoritative answers upon asking, but are extremely valuable and still result in answers that are clearly ""the best"". See for example on physics stackexchange:</p>

<p><a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/121879/can-i-compute-the-mass-of-a-coin-based-on-the-sound-of-its-fall"">Can I compute the mass of a coin based on the sound of its fall?</a></p>

<p>My feeling is that it's important to exclude ""trivial"" list answers to avoid cluttering up the site. However, I do think some list answers can be extremely valuable and add a lot of content to what this site aims to do (which I do understand opens up ambiguity on who decides what is and isn't trivial - but usually it's pretty clear). </p>

<p>But most importantly, I think there is a lot of grey area on what questions can or can't facilitate authoritative responses, especially when real understanding of history is best communicated through debate and many (at times contradictory) sources.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>As I noted in my comment; it's going to be difficult, in any non-trivial example, to isolate ""burning things down"" as a key cause of success. That's because ""burning things down"" isn't usually the only step up from a peaceful protest, it usually goes hand-in-hand with greater violence towards other people (police, other security services, etc) and looting, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>To prove that ""burning things down"" was a factor, you have to indulge in a counter-factual (which are frowned upon here). That is, you have to prove that remaining peaceful (or simply not ""burning things down"") wouldn't have ultimately provided the same result.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of prior research. The downvote button lists ""This question does not show any research effort"" as a reason to down vote. As written, this question doesn't demonstrate any prior research (i.e. what do you know already, what have you discounted, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Too broad. A ""protest"" can be anything from a local dispute to a country-wide revolution. Successful revolutions can be peaceful but there's usually some fighting involved (and that usually includes some ""burning things down""). So any successful violent revolution would count. At the other end of the scale, a protest over the siting of, say, an abortion clinic could turn nasty. If it results in the building being burned down then it could also be claimed as a successful example.</p></li>
<li><p>As you've identified yourself, this is a list question. These are generally looked down on in this stack (although there are exceptions).  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Interestingly, the reason for closure was being ""off-topic"". The voters felt that the question was a better fit on one of the other stacks.</p>

<p>Finally, people are under no obligation to explain or justify their downvotes anymore than they are required to explain or justify their upvotes.

<p>When I read the question, two examples of protests that successfully influenced public policy sprang to mind. But if I were to name the examples, I believe it would generate a pointless discussion about the politics of the issues involved.  Discussion of whether the protests were legitimate, were they effective, was the policy changed in response to the protests or not, was the policy prudent or foolish, etc.  In short, if I name the example, <em>I</em> expect to generate discussion about the examples, not about the principle in the question (I please guilty to cynicism, but it is <em>informed</em> cynicism).

There is no clear criteria that enables us to say - ""Protest movement X resulted in change Y"", without someone saying, ""Protest movement X was really about Z"", or ""Change Y was driven by faction W, not protest X"" or ""Protest Movement P was similar to protest movement X in all ways, but did not result in change, so your thesis is invalid"".

The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion#Later_analysis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> article includes an entire section on post-conflict analysis.   Google provides 380,000 suggested results, the first of which is an analysis from the <a href=""https://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-in-History/The-Bay-of-Pigs.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JFK library</a>, which ought to be pretty credible.  As the site help files suggest, H:SE exists to supplement Wikipedia and Google, not to replace them.   In May of 2014 the first comment alerted you to the problem, but you provided no response.  One of the best ways to demonstrate that you've done the preliminary research is to provide a link to the research. and a comment indicating why that research didn't answer your question. </p></li>
<li><p>asked ""Why not"" - Questions that ask why something <strong>didn't</strong> happen are always marginal - the site conventions clearly indicate that speculation and alternative history are off topic.  Historical sources and methods can be used to analyze things that did happen, but even with history that actually happened, history can't always provide a credible causality.   Once we cross the border into analyzing things that didn't happen, historical sources and methods are much weaker.  I think there is some latitude for military questions because post-action analysis is a common part of military history. If you'd addressed some of the other issued, the question might have passed muster.</p></li>
<li><p>Your question provided three assertions without supporting evidence (they were funded, they were armed, they were supplied), and implies that those three facts should have led to victory. If military planning were that simple, the Secretary of Defense would be paid a lot less.  War is an adversarial endeavor; just as no battle plan survives contact with the enemy, there is frequently no clear cut cause for actions and outcomes.  These unsupported, unsourced, non-trivial assertions cause the question to read less like a request for a historical answer, and more like political speech.  If you want to re-open the question, you might flip these assertions into questions. (Note: this is my opinion; there are others who will disagree because they feel that subquestions are anathema.)  If you're really asking for an analysis of the relative importance of funding, armament and logistics in the success of this military action, then ask that question. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>In my personal opinion, the quesiton is on the edge. It isn't a period of history that interests me, and I personally am strongly turned  off by questions that demonstrate no preliminary research.  If the issues above were fixed, I might be more inclined to vote to re-open.</p>

At first, I misunderstood the questions; I thought these questions were doubting the accepted narrative. After some discussion, I now understand that these are part of a pattern of shoring up sources (what in my field we call ""improving assurance"").</p>

<p>I believe it is a core part of the practice of history to scrutinize sources, to look for supporting and conflicting sources; doing so provides valuable context and assurance. </p>

<p>How do we distinguish between questions that merely indicate that the querent is unwilling to accept historical narrative (which give me a mental rash), and questions like Mr. Arifin's that seek to examine the role of the source in the historical narrative.</p>

<p>@NSNoob expresses the problem in a comment to that question, which I'll repeat here for convenience,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is kind of like ""Wikipedia says Allies won WW2. But I see no information about the authenticity of this conclusion. Do historians accept it?"". It would be a good question if you were to show your research as to why you don't believe Wikipedia article isn't authentic enough and why would you tend to believe otherwise</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of the ""Questioning the narrative"" questions fall into the trap that @NSnoob describes.</p>

<p>I think that Called2Voyage's suggestion of a meta-template for questions of this type would both resolve the pattern for Mr. Arifin, and encourage more of the kind of questions we want.  </p>

<p>I down voted this question because it is complete nonsense for anyone who has read Chinese History. It also has no sources at all; a non-trivial assertion like ""China didn't have writing until the Tang Dynasty"" should certainly have a source that refutes <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Written_Chinese#Evolution"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the commonly portrayed history of Chinese writing</a>.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I don't think it should be deleted; it contains valuable information in that we have downvoted it, and provided refutation in the comments. If we delete it, we loose both. And the reputation of SE should remain high enough that our votes will matter to those who care, and those who like crackpot theories won't pay attention either way.  Someone who might be enticed by the crazy theories, but sees that it is down voted, might decide to view the other answers as well.</p>

<p>Only questions which are less than 60 days old can be migrated; this rule applies also to moderators. Developers are able to bypass this restriction, but they only do so in very, <em>very</em> rare cases.</p>
<p><strong>Any user with 3,000 reputation</strong> can vote to migrate a question to another site via a list of up to five sites, which are most relevant to that site. Simply load the close dialog, select the <strong>off-topic because</strong> close reason, and then select <strong>belongs on another site</strong> in the off-topic reason list. This will present the list of available migration targets.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OYUH3.png"" alt=""Getting to the migrate screen"" /></p>
<p>On Stack Overflow, migration requires a super-majority when closing, which means that it will only be migrated automatically if <em>four</em> users vote to migrate it to the same site, on other sites, three votes for the same target suffice.</p>
<p>If you <strong>don't have 3,000 reputation</strong>, the <strong>site isn't in the list</strong> of available migration targets, or the <strong>question got closed without being migrated</strong>, you can flag the question for moderator attention and request that they migrate it for you. Simply explain in the reason which site you want it to be migrated. (Please select <em>one</em> site; don't list all possible sites it <em>could</em> go to.)</p>
<h3>Things to consider when migrating questions</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Don't migrate crap!</strong> Ever. If the question is likely to be closed on the destination site anyway, don't bother migrating it. Just close it normally and advise the OP of the other site in the comments. If they decide to improve the question, then they can go post it over there, or they can edit their question and have it migrated later.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid migrating answered questions.</strong> The point of migration is to send the question to a place where it is on-topic and <em>can</em> get answered. If the OP already has an answer, then we've already defeated the purpose of migration and the destination site won't have anything to do with the question. Avoid migrating these questions unless they are of extremely good quality and risk deletion on their current site.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Don't migrate for the sake of migration.</strong> We only migrate questions because they are <em>off-topic on the original site</em>. It is perfectly possible for a question to be on-topic on multiple sites, but that is not a reason to migrate it elsewhere. As a general rule, if someone asks a question <em>here</em>, and it's on-topic <em>here</em>, it should stay <em>here</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Be familiar with the destination site.</strong> If you have never even visited the destination site before, read through the FAQ thoroughly and <em>make sure</em> the question actually belongs there. Don't look at the name of a site and automatically assume the question can be asked there. Each site has its own rules, and rules vary greatly across sites.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>If you're not sure, don't migrate it.</strong> Let someone else who <em>is</em> sure do that, or ask for opinions from the community in a relevant chat room.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What causes a migration to be rejected and what happens after?</h2>
<p>A migration can be automatically rejected before it even gets migrated if any of the following conditions apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user is question-banned or suspended on the destination site</li>
<li>The question does not contain any tags that exist on the destination site (and the destination site isn't a meta site)</li>
<li>The question is an <em>exact</em> duplicate of <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/97632/check-to-make-sure-a-duplicate-does-not-exist-before-migrating/225679#225679"">another question on the destination site</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A question can also be rejected by the target community after it has already been migrated if it gets closed as a reason other than duplicate, or gets deleted (usually by the owner) on the target site. When a question which was already migrated gets rejected, the entire process of the migration is reversed. All the answers are returned to the origin site and undeleted* and are subsequently deleted on the target site.</p>
<p><strong>*Note:</strong> If the question was already deleted on the origin site, migration rejection does <em>not</em> cause the question to be undeleted.</p>

Constantine was the first to split them (and first Christian Emperor), while Julian was the last sole Emperor of both halves (and the last Pagan emperor). So that gives a fuzzy start time in the range of 300-400. It would end with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire_under_the_Heraclian_dynasty#Heraclius.27_rule"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Heraclius' reorganization</a> (early 600's). </p>

I understand the Greeks themselves, and those in their sphere, called their empire ""Roman"" to the end.</p>

<p>Now with my <strong>janitor</strong> hat on, I'll say that I'd be pleased to help with whichever the stack decides to do. If we keep them separate, the tags' wikis will probably still need some attention to make sure the distinction is as clear as possible, and it wouldn't hurt to give the tagged questions a quick run-through to make sure they are properly tagged to the updated descriptions.</p>

Doing that <em>nearly</em> saved it (it took a long time before it picked up close vote 5). </p>

<p>It probably should not be that way, but it is. Heck, I (embarrassingly) do it too sometimes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Now if that was the entirety of the question, knowing our users I'd expect it to get closed. That question is undoubtedly asking for an opinion, and arguably an opinion on something that might have happened in an alternate universe (one where the US never invented nuclear weapons. Which raises more questions. Eg: How did the Pacific War end in this alternate universe? How would a US that lost a million extra men in WWII feel about fronting Europe with extra ground forces. More likely? Less likely?) We have multiple users here who call such questions ""counterfactuals"", and will merrily VTC them.</p>

<p>Again, I'm not saying your question is wrong. Quite likely your are completely right that it should be considered on-topic. I'm just <em>advising</em> that when you carefully craft the verbiage of a question to keep it on-topic, you should try to put <strong>just as much care into the title</strong>. More actually, because titles have to be short too.</p>

<p>(Which is sadly only applicable to answers, due to its wording).</p>

<p>There is also a ""lock"" status that can be put on older questions that comes with this post notice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question exists because it has historical significance, but <strong>it is not considered a good, on-topic question for this site</strong>, so please do not use it as evidence that you can ask similar questions here.

<p>I would much rather see older questions flagged for this kind of lock, rather than see them get closed years after their post date.</p>

<p>Either we just recently got the option to deploy these, or it's been there a while and I didn't notice until about a month ago due to my own incompetence (this one is probably more likely). But either way, they are an option now. I'm not sure if there's a way on this site for users or reviewers to get these added. However, if you see a post that could use one of these, flag it with a note saying so. Also please flag to get them removed, if one is no longer applicable, of course.</p>

Now, I'm the new kid on the block, as it were, since I only discovered History Stack Exchange a month or so back, so please bear with me if what I'm asking is already old news to some of you. I've read the Help Centre sections on <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/asking"">asking</a> and <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/answering"">answering</a> questions, and I've tried searching here on Meta, but I think I may be still missing something.</p>

<p>For example, I've seen a number of questions that have been closed because there is no known answer. <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/38503/who-was-responsible-for-the-murder-of-elizabeth-short-aka-the-black-dahlia-was"">This question</a> about the killer of Elizabeth Short (The Black Dahlia murder) is actually a pretty good example.</p>

<p>Now, I found <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2001/24858"">this question here on Meta</a>, and that seems to suggest that it's OK to <em>answer</em> a question with no known answer, but still leaves open the suggestion that they are somehow ""bad questions"". This bothers me.</p>

<p>I would argue that there is no known answer for an awful lot of things that have happened in history. Generally, that is where the conspiracy theorists and fantasists step in and have a field-day! The problem is compounded when historians and archaeologists aren't prepared to step up to the plate and attempt to provide the best answers we can. (A case in point would be <a href=""http://www.daniken.com/en/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Erich von Daniken</a> and his Chariots' of the Gods!).</p>

<p>Now, I think we can, and we should, offer an answer here - provided that answer is based on the available evidence. If we have researched the question, we should at least be able to offer an answer along the following lines:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Nobody knows the answer. Here's the evidence, such as it is. Make up
  your own mind.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(The quote is taken from my comment to the question linked above)</p>

<p>This site has been in Beta for 5 years. The number of questions per day (and also the number of answers per question) are <a href=""https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/5169/history"">considered to be too low</a>. [In fact, I just noticed that the number of questions per day has actually fallen from 5.1 to 5 in the last month].</p>

<p>Which brings me to my actual questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Do we really want to shut down valid historical questions just
because there is no known answer?</li>
<li>Do people agree with me that we shouldn't be deleting questions just
because they have no known answer? And equally, if not, why not?</li>

<p>I personally hate the close rate and some of the rules we have. I cringe on some of the 'no homework' and 'no book reviews' closes, hoping a child somewhere didn't just get denied a chance to develop an interest in History. There are times I'll admit to putting an answer on a question I knew would be closed, because I found an answer I thought relevant. And I'll accept the downvotes accordingly.

A question about the Lizzie Borden murder trial might have meaning in the then-contemporary views of female vs. male murder suspects. But here, a woman (aka Black Dahlia) was the victim, as has often been the case through human history, and not the perpetrator.

Of course I could have went to Google and/or ask my teacher, but I automatically went to History SE without thinking probably because of the higher support rate here.</p>

<p>You argue that since the main thrust of the question isn't <em>about</em> the Protestant Church <em>per-se</em>, then the tag is inappropriate.</p>

<p>IMHO, both of you are correct. It is just a problem of perspective.</p>

<p>The OP obviously felt strongly enough about it to roll-back your initial tag-edit. That being the case (and since the tag wiki provides no clear guidance to the contrary) I think I would probably defer to the OP's rollback. It is, after all, their question.</p>

Wish I had done that.</em></p>

<p>Second, let me recommend that we update the tag wiki to resolve the question. Although <em>I</em> would suggest that the tag wiki indicate that the tag should only be used for questions about the Protestant church beginning at the Protestant reformation. OP would probably argue that the tag should be applied to questions about the Protestant Church <strong>and</strong> the events that enabled the church.  I believe that <strong>an</strong> answer is more important than <strong>the</strong> answer; that a bad concurrence is better than a virtuous argument.  (Perhaps we could create two tags - one that refers to the Protestant church after the reformation and a second tag the refers to the origin of the Protestant church?</p>

<p><strong>IF</strong> OP were asking about the Protestant church, I would agree that the tag would be appropriate.  However, his insistence that he is looking for Protest sources prior to the Protestant reformation undermines his assertion.  The tag war is a symptom.</p>

<p>OP is extending from Foxes assertion that all of these sects were martyrs to the Protestant faith to reach the conclusion that the Protestant Church existed before the reformation.  </p>

<p>So let's do the comparative advantage analysis : </p>

<ul>
<li><p>If we use the tag, then users searching for Protestant Church will find this question and learn things which are false; this diminishes the value of H:SE. OP's experience will not be diminished; I will assert that there is nobody who would answer the question with the tag who would not answer the question without the tag.</p></li>
<li><p>If we don't use the tag, OP's experience will not be changed. (He may experience an affront to his ego, but I think that is quite unavoidable at this point).  Nobody's search will be diminished, since nobody is going to search for Protestant Church.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(OP would counter argue that these early dissenters were formative for the Protestant Church. I can't remember the name of that fallacy, but essentially it is a recursion problem without a stopping condition.  Everything is affected by things that come before, but by that logic the big bang is formative for teh Protestant church.  Common sense should apply, and we should not (in the general case) apply a tag to events the preceeded the existence of that tag.)</p>

<p>At least as far as I can see the greater benefit is to remove the tag.</p>

It didn't look to have much to do with history, but I happened to know the answer, so I answered it anyway.</p>

<p>I was asked whether this had ever actually happened in practice in a comment on my answer. I thought this was a good question, and updated the original question, and my answer, to reflect it.</p>

<p>One comment suggested that my ""surgical edit"" meant that the question met the ""threshold"" for History:SE, but that it would be a better fit for Politics:SE. I'm not sure exactly what this ""threshold"" is, or where it's documented.</p>

<p>Either way, the question was migrated to Politics:SE.</p>

<hr>

<p>Then we had a question about whether the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/39555/24858"">1864 US presidential election could have been postponed without a constitutional amendment</a>. Now, this looks to be a pretty clear. It's a question about history, right?</p>

<p>Apparently not. The consensus view again seems to be that this should be on Politics:SE. This was even backed up with a view that the question is ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfactual_history"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">counterfactual</a>"", and so a better fit on Politics:SE.</p>

<p>Well, let's break it down:</p>

<ol>
<li>It begins with an assertion that there were proposals to delay the
election, that these met little support, and that Lincoln rejected
them. All factually correct, although the OP failed to cite their
sources in the question.</li>
<li>Then there is a question: would a delay have been possible without a constitutional amendment? Now, that is a matter of fact, and can be answered with historical evidence.</li>
<li>Then the OP quotes the results of a recent poll (and subsequently added a link to their source).</li>
<li>Finally, the OP asked a follow-up question: ""Would the legal feasibility of such a postponement be any different from the 1864 case?"" - again, a matter of fact and, as it happens, actually answered with the same historical sources as the first question.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, nothing counterfactual there.</p>

<p>[Perhaps this is a good time to mention that I'm not a registered user on Politics:SE for (what I consider to be) two very good reasons.</p>

<p>The first is that - as far as I can see - too much of their content is opinion, rather than evidence, based.</p>

<p>The second reason I've avoided Politics:SE is that there <em>is</em> a lot of counterfactual argument/discussion there. Frankly, I wasted far too much of my life on discussions about counterfactual history when I was an undergrad/postgrad student of history/archaeology.]</p>

<p>The question is currently closed as ""off-topic"".</p>

<hr>

<p>Then, a couple of days ago, we had a question about <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/39582/24858"">whether an American political party had a legal personality anywhere at any time</a>.</p>

<p>Again, the almost knee-jerk reaction in the comments seemed to be ""This should be on Politics:SE"". One comment even suggesting that it had already been asked and answered there (it hadn't).</p>

<p>This time, there's been a bit more debate in the comments about whether the question is on topic here. As I write, the question remains open ...</p>

<hr>

<p>However, the fact remains that three questions have attracted close votes in the last couple of weeks on the basis that they are about politics - even though two of them (arguably all of them, if the comment about the ""threshold"" is taken at face value) are clearly about the <em>history</em> of politics). So that prompts my question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Are questions about the history of politics on-topic here?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Perhaps the issue is only when the questions are about <em>US</em> politics, as that is also the case with all three of these questions].</p>

<p>As for the question of ""fit"", presumably the very fact that the questions are posted here means that the OP (in most cases) is interested in the history underpinning the question. Personally, I'm not convinced that migrating questions in that circumstance helps either the OP or this site.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, I know that, in theory, and at time-of-writing, History:SE has 378 users who have earned sufficient privilege (500) to cast close votes. In reality, I've noticed that close votes always seem to show the same dozen-or-so names. I'm hoping that most users who cast close-votes also use the meta site and will contribute to the discussion.</p>

<p>One question was about the legal form of U.S. Political parties beginning in the 1790s. That is clearly history. The fact that the Federal Election Act (FEA) of 1971 addresses this point doesn't make it (predominantly) politics, because the question was about what happened before the FEA.</p>

<p>The second question was about whether ""the 1864 Presidential election <em>could have been</em> postponed..."" The ""could have been"" makes the question hypothetical or counterfactual, because it was <em>not</em> postponed. The question then goes on to ask what lessons can be drawn for the 2020 election (futuristic and political,not historical.) I might have accepted a question about 1864, worded as ""what rules in place governed the 1864 proposal for postponement without a constitutional amendment"" (the proposal is historical, the postponement is not). But adding ""current events"" to a supposedly historical question was too much for me. </p>

<p>One last thing, as you rightly pointed out. The ""standards"" of Politics SE are different from here, which helps make some questions better for that site than this one. FWIW, I'm on both sites, with > 1000 reputation on each. So If I honestly believe that the tone and content of a question is a better fit for Politics (or any other site) than this one, I will flag for migration.</p>

<p>The question about the veto was primarily political and the reference was to Donald Trump, i.e. the current President. That makes it ""non-historical,"" IMHO. It would probably be different if someone asked about the time a 19th or early 20th century President exercised a pocket veto, and why did the historical ""fall out"" take place. When I said that your edit made it technically acceptable for the site, I was complimenting your editing, not the question (even in its current form). That is to say, I would (barely) accept it on a ""standalone"" basis (e.g. if history were the only SE site), but move to migrate it to Politics, where it is a better fit.</p>

I wasn't able to find one that would stand up to rigorous academic scrutiny (sources of potential bias in the data are obvious in every example I found), but <a href=""http://discontents.com.au/when-did-the-great-war-become-the-first-world-war/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> does contain a nice interactive graph.</p>

<p>The suggestion is that use of ""<em>First World War</em>"" and ""<em>World War 1</em>"" overtook the phrase ""<em>The Great War</em>"" in general use in about 1941.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the question is not as trivial as it first appeared.</p>

<p>I would vote to close a question about inheritance laws in monarchies. Different monarchies have different laws/customs/traditions. Salic law applies to France, but not to England.  Inheritance law is different in Scotland than in England despite the fact that they share a monarch. In Belgium, the monarch must be Catholic, but in England that is illegal.  Some Saxon kingdoms permitted women to rule; some required that the new king share a lineage with the old king; other Saxon kingdoms forbid women to rule and permitted anyone who could muster the forces to ""inherit"".  Polish kings were elected according to Eldridge Gerry. Paris was worth a Mass.  At the end of the Elizabethan period, it was a crime punishable by death to discuss inheritance of the crown.  Venetian Doges were elected by a multi-step process in order to guarantee that the process would be controlled by corruption and could never be completed without corruption.  There are no readily identifiable class of inheritance laws in monarchies any more than there are chore divisions in marriages.   </p>

<p>On top of that, ""Monarchy"" is a form of government ( a class of similar, but not identical types of government.)  It doesn't really make sense to ask ""What is the law that binds the class of individuals who make laws?""  Autocratic monarchs could set their own rules for inheritance, and could break them a year later (Henry II, IIRC)  Constitutional monarchs must adhere to their constitution (England after the Glorious Revolution).</p>

<p>The point is that if you're asking about history, you need to ask about the history of a specific monarchy at a specific time.  Otherwise the answer is like dividing by zero - undefined and explicitly out of scope of the subject.  </p>

<p>Of course, I may be entirely wrong about the motivation. To be fair, I'm not sure that I really <em>get</em> the whole reputation/badges system as motivation, so perhaps I should take a moment to explain how I see it.</p>

<p>Yes, it makes perfect sense to me that there is a system of ""<a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/privileges"">reputation</a>"" that gradually opens features of the site as users gain more experience (and hence ""reputation"" points). But once a user has unlocked all the site privileges the system has the potential to become counter-productive.</p>

<p>Besides, a ""poor"" answer is a poor answer, whether it's posted by a user with a reputation of 100 or a user with a reputation of 100K.</p>

<p>As for <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/badges"">badges</a>, when I first heard that SE awarded badges for participation it reminded me a little of the days when we were given gold stars at primary school. It also brought to mind a scene from Mel Brook's 1974 classic movie spoof ""Blazing Saddles""! (Google is your friend if you're not familiar with it)</p>

<p>[Having said all that, given how much I've had to fight against people telling me to specialise over the years, the idea of a ""<a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/badges/15/generalist"">Generalist</a>"" badge does have a sneaking appeal, even to an old cynic like me! ;-)]</p>

The likely result is that history is likely to get bent or twisted for the sake of the game. That is to say that the game might contain ""some"" elements that are suggested or inspired by ""history"" without coming close enough to the actual facts to the be accurate. The danger is that games, and questions based on games, are likely to introduce ""false facts."" that ""pass"" as ""history,"" thereby misleading, rather than educating, players.</p>

<p>The one game featured a boy who could look into the future and see that his potential career paths branched into 1) the ""King of England"" or 2) a ""scientist"" who was a disciple of Faraday. The resulting question was, which boy does this ""best"" describe. The answer was Prince Albert, Consort of Queen Victoria. The problem is that it introduces several inaccuracies. 1) ""Prince Consort of England is no the same as ""king"" (close, but no cigar). 2) Albert was not a ""scientist,"" only a sponsor of science, but the member of the royal family most likely to do this. 3) Michael Faraday never gave a Christmas lecture in 1831, and Albert would have met him in a much later year.</p>

<p>Here's another example: There is a World War II game, Allies and Axis, where the Allies have a clear advantage, but the Axis can win if they ""get lucky"" with the dice. One might ask, is this game an accurate representation of the war? Did the Axis actually have a 1-in-10 or 1-in-5 chance of winning the war as of spring, 1942? Answer: No, because in the game, the U.S. has only one-third or so of its historical capacity, enough to make the allies favorites, but not enough to ""guarantee"" allied Victory.</p>

<p>Secondly, even were we to introduce your ""litmus test"", I would argue (as someone who is often paid to carry out historical research, and who therefore probably qualifies as a ""professional historian"") that the subject matter of both questions <em>would</em> be of interest to professional historians - regardless of the inspiration for those questions on this site.</p>

<hr>

<p>The first question is about whether Mozart was ever addressed by a particular pet name by his wife, Constanze. If the evidence survived, I have no doubt that professional historians would expend almost as much ink on the subject as they have on the pet names used by <a href=""https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OMP93v2i7qQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Winston and Clementine Churchill</a>.</p>

<p>In this case, however, the answer has to do with historiography, or perhaps ""how we know what we know about history"". Simply put, the evidence of the letters from Clementine to Winston Churchill survive; the letters from Constanze to Mozart do not (as I pointed out in my answer). We know the pet names used for Mozart by his family, but not by his wife.</p>

<p>Should letters to Mozart from his wife ever turn up in an archive somewhere, I think we can be fairly certain that historians, both professional and amateur, will be interested in their contents, not least in how Constanze addresses her husband. </p>

<hr>

<p>The second question relates to a (slightly ridiculous in my opinion) suggestion that Henry VIII of England required that the door to his chambers was bricked up each night. As you point out, the inspiration for that question is a children's history-themed television show.</p>

<p>However, as was also pointed out in the question (and in my answer) the reason for that particular historical assertion (I cannot bring myself to call it a ""fact"") being included in the show was that it stemmed from a claim by the owners of Allington Castle, and had sparked the interest of the professional historian, <a href=""http://www.gregjenner.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Greg Jenner</a>, who acts as historical adviser to the show. Clearly, therefore, in this case the answer to the question ""<em>Would a professional historian be interested in the subject matter?</em>"" is, simply, ""<em>Yes</em>"".</p>

Different cultures define race differently, and there is no objective definition.  If you ask a question about race and don't define your terms objectively, I reserve the right to downvote.  </p>

<p>This also applies to questions about genetics; there are fields where genetics can contribute to history - Analysis of the Saxon conquest of England, or the descendants of Ghengis Khan.

<p>Anyone even remotely familiar with Soviet history knows that Stalin grew up in Georgia. BBC even had a documentary that mocked his accent, when he spoke Russian. This person not only lied about it, but made up a fake fact that he was from Moscow. The 4 people who upvoted this were probably sock puppets.</p>

<p>Another example:</p>

<p>This was at +11 until recently. The question is unsourced, silly, perpetuates a negative stereotype about an ethnic group, <em>and</em> completely off-topic. Clicking on the poster's profile, I see he's a self-proclaimed communist/socialist/Maxist (Which I find hard to believe, in this day and age, given how dystopian all of the many Marxist countries got, so I'm thinking it's a toll account too).</p>

<p>Should we do anything about the troll problem?</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> My point is that this SE section has <strong>very</strong> unreliable content. If you read it, you might be learning something new, but more often than not, you are just reading some made up facts that got upvoted either by sock puppets, trolls, or people who didn't know very much. The fact that you chose to downvote me to try to sweep this under the rug instead of acknowledging and addressing the problem speaks volumes.</p>

<hr>

<p>In the first example, yes they have certainly made a mistake about Stalin. He correctly states that Stalin's father was from Georgia, but claimed Stalin was from ""Moscow's district"". You claim this was a lie (implying intent), but I don't see evidence of that. However, the main thrust of the answer is about Khrushchev, and that seems to be broadly correct (I'm not sure how well it answers the actual question, but that's a different point). Where Stalin was born seems largely irrelevant in context.</p>

<p>Reading the comments attached to the answer, at least one of those who upvoted the answer is an experienced, high-reputation user who is definitely NOT a sock-puppet.</p>

<p>The answer was posted over three years ago, and the user hasn't been active on SE since. I certainly can't find any other posts by this user on SE that support your contention that it is a troll account.</p>

<hr>

<p>The second question has been put on hold as off-topic because it is primarily opinion-based. The OP is based in Florida, and the question is - presumably - based on their experience. Reading the answers, I notice that nobody seriously challenged the OP's observations about the US school history curriculum (and I think we've all noticed the decline in the quality of program content on the History Channel!).</p>

I also took a look at some of the available data on the site, and I suspect we <em>might</em> have a problem. This might be an uncomfortable question, but I think we need to have the debate.</p>

<p>But first the posts ...</p>

<hr>

<p>The first of these was <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/40304/24858"">this post</a> about Nixon's visit to China.</p>

<p>Now, I happened to see the question as it was posted. To be honest, my first reaction was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Another request for trivia. Don't these people know how to use
  Google?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then two things gave me pause.</p>

<ul>
<li>Firstly, it asks about ""<em>past policies</em>"" (plural). As far as I know,
the visit went against his own previous policy (as expressed during
his 1964 visit to Asia). I wasn't aware of any other policy, and a
brief Google search didn't find any either.</li>
<li>The second point was that this was the first post by a new user.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I added a comment asking the OP to add a link to the article. I figured that would clarify the question. I also hoped that asking the OP to include a link to their source would encourage them to do so in future as well.</p>

<p>Five minutes later (just <em>6 minutes</em> after the question had been posted!) it got the first vote-to-close (surprisingly, perhaps, not because it's a request for trivia, but because of ""<em>Uncited source no evidence of research</em>""). </p>

<p>Well, this was 2am, so I just posted the best answer I could and called it a night.</p>

<p>The follwowing morning, the question had been closed (hardly a surprise, if I'm being honest), but the OP had added a link to the article. The article states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The shorthand is “Nixon goes to China,” meaning a moment in which a
  leader reverses his past positions to do something that is shocking
  but beneficial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which, presumably, explains the plural ""<em>past policies</em>"" in the question.</p>

<p>Hopefully, in this case the OP hasn't been put-off using History:SE by their experience, but a glance at the list of users suggests that others may have been. More on that later.</p>

<hr>

<p>The second post was yesterday. It asked <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/40360/24858"">what made a region an ""upper"" or a ""lower"" region</a>. At the time of writing, the question has 3 down-votes as a ""request for trivia"". As originally posted, the question certainly showed that the OP had carried out some research:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""There doesn't seem to be a correlation with altitude, relative
  orientation, or size. Maybe up or down river?</p>
  
  <p>I imagine it's reminiscent of the Roman empire, but I'm uncertain.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, personally, I would say that the question was trivial to answer, but then my father was a land surveyor, so I'm probably at an unfair advantage. On balance, I think I'd agree with T.E.D. and Tom's comments and say that it is a perfectly reasonable question.</p>

<p>In particular, Tom's comment about how to improve the question is an example of just the sort of thing that I think we should be doing more.</p>

<p>Again, this was a user who was new to History:SE. At the time of writing, they have made their opinions about the people who down-voted the question clear in the comments to the question. On the basis of that comment, I'd guess History:SE wouldn't be getting any 5-star reviews!</p>

<p>So should we be handling questions from new users better?</p>

<hr>

<p>According to the site stats, at the time of posting, we have 17,317 users. That sounds like an impressive number, but I'm a bit of a data nerd - I like to try and understand data trends. I took a look at the user lists.</p>

<p>On 20 September 2017 there were 443 pages of users (each page displaying 36 users).</p>

<p>Of these:</p>

<ul>
<li>162 pages of users have a reputation of 1.</li>
<li>171 pages have a reputation of 101 (a majority of these are probably new
users who have the site association bonus).</li>
</ul>

<p>Which leaves just 110 pages, or 3960 users. That's not quite as impressive.</p>

<p>[Several pages of users have scores just below 100. I'd guess that a number of them joined the site with the association bonus and posted questions/answers that attracted down-votes. Without better data-analysis tools it would be too laborious to try to identify them, but it is worth remembering that the figure of 3960 is probably a slight over-estimate].</p>

<p>Now, I'm sure that many of the users with a reputation of 1 or 101 have joined the site out of interest, and just haven't had a particular question to ask, or answer to give. Others have probably just joined to answer a specific post that they came across as a HNQ or that came up in the results of a Google search. Nevertheless, these figures do make me wonder if we are intimidating new users away from the site.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, don't misunderstand me. I think that poor-quality questions should either be improved or deleted.</p>

<p>Had the first question above been posted by a user with a rep of 501, or even 201, I'd have said that the comments, down-votes, and votes-to-close were entirely justified. But shouldn't new users be given a chance to learn what's expected of them before their question is deleted?</p>

<ul>
<li>If it looks like a request for trivia, post a comment and ask them if
they've looked on Wikipedia or Google. Ask them what their research
has found so far.</li>
<li>If they haven't quoted their source, maybe we should just ask for it
in a comment?</li>
<li>Perhaps we should direct them to the Site Tour and the Help Centre?
Especially if they look to be very new to SE.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>At the very least, shouldn't we give them something more than 6 minutes before we vote to close their questions?</p>

<p>Here's the kind of things a moderator can do with a problematic post:</p>

<ul>
<li>Close an answer/question. I will usually only do this only in extreme and obvious cases of malfeasance (usually involving Nazis, or the post being utter gibberish, sometimes if an answer is clearly only a comment on another answer).</li>
<li>Delete a post. See above.</li>
<li>Address offensive or abusive content. <strong>Note that these flags are prioritized</strong></li>
<li>Address repeated problem behavior from a single user. Typically I'll notice this myself before you report it, but we mods can warn and in repeated cases temporarily ban problem users. For new unregistered users who post something bad enough for me to delete, I may just flat out destroy their entire account rather than bothering with it. Usually again these are Nazis.</li>
<li>Delete a comment. Any comment that isn't productively trying to improve the post its attached to or its question is fair game for deletion. Actually <em>any</em> comment is fair game for deletion.</li>
<li>Move comments to chat (a slightly gentler version of the previous item)</li>
<li>""Protect"" a post from rando new users. Useful if we're getting repeated horrible answers from &lt;100 rep users on a ""hot"" question.</li>
<li>Add/remove a post notice of either ""Citation Needed, ""Current Event"" (probably not applicable here), or ""Insufficient Explanation"".</li>
<li>Merge the question's answers with another question. (The questions had better be <strong>identical</strong>.)</li>
<li>Lock the post so no votes, edits, comment, or answers can be added. This is useful if some serious shenanigans seem to be happening.</li>
<li>Historical Lock. This is a lock with a post notice saying basically, ""We're keeping this post because its old and interesting, but this would not today be considered a valid post on this site"". <strong>Your second link might be a good candidate for this</strong>. I wouldn't feel comfortable closing/deleting it due to the high number of votes and the vintage, but if asked today I highly suspect it would be closed (and deleted).</li>
<li>Convert an answer to a comment (answer only). I don't like to do this if the poster didn't have the rep to create a comment themselves, because the moderation system should not be (ab)used as a way to get around the reputation limits on commenting. It should also be a comment of at least some value.</li>
<li>Migrate an otherwise good off-topic question to another SE site where it should be on-topic.</li>
</ul>

<p>Things normal users such as yourself can (and should) do, once they gain the required reputation:</p>

<li>Vote on questions and answers. If you think an answer is ""wrong"", this is what you do about it. I generally prefer to upvote right answers and leave the wrong ones alone unless they are really irredeemably atrocious, but your voting strategy is entirely your choice.</li>
<li>Leave comments explaining things an answer may have gotten wrong (eg: Stalin wasn't born in Moscow), so that it may be improved, or worst case voted on accordingly by others.</li>
<li>Vote to close off-topic posts.</li>
<li>Vote to delete closed off-topic posts that are not being fixed by the author.</li>
<li>Edit posts to fix easily fixable issues. Particularly spelling and grammar issues, missing/broken links, etc.</li>

<p>That said, what can we do constructively?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I fully support your suggestion to ask a question rather than level an accusation.  ""What did Wikipedia say?"" is better than ""Insufficient preliminary research"".  (or variations on each).

<li><p>I do my best to avoid hammering English as a Foreign Language speakers - if the grammar/spelling/phrasing indicates that the individual is not a native English speaker, I try to edit rather than downvote.  I should probably begin doing this with new users too, but it is harder to see the 1/101 reputation than it is to see grammatical errors.</p></li>
<li><p>Given that I'm a major culprit of the behavior you describe, I've been trying to split my actions to give more time - When I spot a fatally flawed question I insert a comment asking for a fix and then I move on.  I'll vote to close if the question comes up in the review queue, but I try not to case the first VtC unless the question is egregiously bad. I hope this gives more time for potential fixes.</p></li>
<li><p>We need the periodic reminder that the reason we close questions is to fix them.  (or so I understand).  I wonder if there is a way to search for recently closed questions and try to salvage them.  (there probably is and I'm just not awake enough to spot it. )  I think that most of the questions are salvageable - if OP doesn't check google, there is no amount of editing that will make the question non-trivial.  </p></li>
<li><p>I have tried to offer the trivial answer to the trivial question - if the question can be answered through searching Wikipedia for the primary noun, then just offer a one sentence answer linking to the Wikipedia page.   I avoid VtC on any question with an answer.</p></li>
<li><p>I think the ultimate answer is to implement what has been discussed before; a convention that all questions must include a summary of the prior research. Much of the problem is that the questions are trivial and the system is working.  Questions on programming languages or math or project management are inherently practical.   OP asks a question to solve a problem.  H:SE questions are not (usually) practical, they are founded in curiosity.  There is a larger proportion of the questions that should be closed because they are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>per se trivial - answered by google or wikipedia</p></li>
<li><p>Beer &amp; Pretzels questions - suitable for pub discussion, but not for serious historical research or thought</p></li>
<li><p>Book length (most questions that begin ""Why..."" or ""why not..."" - Causality is not simple. History doesn't consist of X because Y.  Usually any historical event has dozens of interaction precursors, factors, causes, etc.  </p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I fully support your fundamental thesis - that we (including me) need to be more welcoming to those pages of users.  But the quality of questions is already pretty low.  We need to simultaneously (1) discourage bad questions, and (2) encourage novice querents. </p>

<p>RE: Wikipedia is not infallible; I'm not going to argue this point, but a strategy of permitting questions on the basis that Wikipedia might be wrong will certainly transform this site into a cesspool of trivial mediocrity.  If someone asks, ""Wikipedia provides a birthdate for A. Hamilton that contradicts this source and that source, how do I determine which is correct?"" that question is ipso facto not trivial.  It demonstrates research and cannot be answered by Wikipedia.  </p>

<p>[Help] says we don't want to replace Wikipedia.  Neither are we the corrections bureau- Wikipedia has a process for quality control and I would vigorously oppose substituting H:SE for that process.  </p>

<p>@NeMo correctly raises the case where a question is answered by Wikipedia, but Wikipedia is incorrect, misleading or sufficiently incomplete that an average person would walk away with an erroneous understanding of the topic.  For the record, I do not argue this point; I acknowledge that such cases exist.  </p>

<p>My problem is one of relative weight.  I think trivial questions are toxic to H:SE.  H:SE relies on people practicing a fairly advanced skillset to do research on behalf of our querents. To me, the greatest danger is that we'll lose our experts because they don't want to spend their time doing a copy and paste from Wikipedia and google.  I think we should permit the use of LMGTFY, although I respect the communal decision to forbid that tool.  I come here to exercise my brain and my research skills, and every time I find another series of ""what is 2+2?"", or ""What was G Washington's first name?"", my enthusiasm diminishes - this is a waste of time.  This is <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/broken-windows-theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">broken window theory</a>.  Trivial questions send a signal to the members that the participants of this SE are content with copy and paste, and are correspondingly less likely to provide content that is educational.  Bad questions communicate something very clearly about the quality and depth of the forum.  I believe that there is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gresham's Law</a> of questions - bad questions drive out good.</p>

<p>@NeMo has challenged whether I understand his point - I think I do, but  I have different priorities/preferences, and while I acknowledge the truth of his point, I think that it is less important than the danger of trivial questions.  (I've provided a somewhat longwinded example below) The point is that there is a class of questions where consultation of Wikipedia will result in an erroneous answer.  The core question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are such questions trivial?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I understand it, @NeMo says that such questions are not trivial because the interpretation requires some skill and subtlety (perhaps my example wasn't as far off base as I first thought).  Let me repeat again, I'm not saying that @NeMo is wrong.  If I've said anything that indicates disrespect for @NeMo's position or person, I'll revise it.</p>

<p>But I disagree with him even though he may be right.  I once heard an MBA assert that everything in reality can be broken down to a 2x2 matrix.  In this case, the axis are ""frequency"" and ""Importance"".</p>

<p>I think that trivial questions are a frequent and important stain on H:SE - I occupy the Upper Left quadrant of that matrix - Frequency High, Importance High.  In my opinion, questions that appear trivial but are actually complex are in lower half of the graph, probably midway between the two quadrants.  They are <em>extremely</em> infrequent and of middling importance.  Because I assign the weights this way, I think that @NeMo's concern is valid, but not actionable, while the trivial question problem is an existential threat to H:SE. I suspect that @NeMo might assign different weights to the two axis - I'm not going to put words in his mouth.</p>

<p>There is a second point - how easily can we recover from the two dangers.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Trivial questions need to be closed, closed fast and closed hard.  The quality of the site relies on having interesting questions at the top front. We could just do the copy/paste exercise, but is anyone seriously going to participate in a forum full of questions of the form, ""What is G. Washington's first name?""  Are you going to want to participate with people who do want to engage with that?</p></li>
<li><p>there is a simple way to recover from Misleading Wikipedia questions.  Let's take the worst case - someone asked a question that is closed because it appears trivial, but it is not trivial.  In such a case, anyone spotting the problem can revise the problem to point out the ambiguity.  ""I see Hamilton born in this year here and in that year on Wikipedia - which is correct?"" or ""I don't understand the answers that Wikipedia provided to 'who is buried in Grant's tomb'""?</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h1>Aside: an example</h1>

<p>Just as an example, ""What color was Washington's white horse?""   (turns out it isn't as good an example as I thought, because Wikipedia does not provide the expected answer, but it does provide an array of partial answers which are all wrong.  )  Wikipedia provides</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_white"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dominant White</a></p></li>
<li><p>and under <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse#Colors_and_markings"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Horse</a> there is a section that hints at the correct answer, but fails to actually provide the answer. </p></li>
<li><p>The white disambiguation page provides a link to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_(horse)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">White(horse)</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>(as documented elsewhere, my normal standard is that if the answer isn't clear in the first five responses, then the question is not trivial).</p>

<p>So my summary of @NeMo's point is that the question ""What color is Washington's White horse?"" is not, in fact trivial, because none of the answers found on Wikipedia will clearly state that the answer is ""Gray"" - because according to breeders, ""Gray"" is  the color name, and ""white"" is a variant. (this is an example, please don't argue the example - it is a distraction from @NeMo's point.)   If I spent more time I could find another example - As I recall, the date of Alexander Hamilton's birthday is frequently wrong on Wikipedia (in part because the true date is not known; Wikipedia isn't very good at discussing the unknown).</p>

<hr>

<p>Note:  While this question <em>might</em> be redundant with this question on the <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/756/1401"">criteria for a trivial question</a>, I'd like to explicitly examine the discussion that @NeMo and I have had in response to the question about <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3530/1401"">support for new users</a>.  I hope this question is more narrowly scoped, and I don't want to continue a discussion in comments.</p>

I don't doubt that you are right about broken window theory in that regard. You might also be right about a Gresham's Law of questions, although the conversations that I've had with other researchers over the last couple of months suggest to me that there might be other reasons why experts may be unwilling to contribute on the site.</p>

<p>However, I'm not at all sure that I agree with your idea that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trivial questions need to be closed, closed fast and closed hard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That they need to be closed (and probably deleted), I agree. But I also think that - in the case of new users - we should take the time to explain why trivial questions are off-topic. At the very least, before closing a question we should post a comment with a link to <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask"">How to Ask</a>. I suspect that everyone wants to improve the quality of questions (and answers), but I think we also want to encourage new users.</p>

<p>I've seen a lot of close-votes coming up in review recently where I would have liked to vote ""<em>Not yet!</em>"". I don't know exactly how long we should wait for a new user to respond to comments / criticism before closing a question, but I do feel it should probably be measured in hours, rather than minutes.</p>

<hr>

<p>[As an aside, I'm becoming increasingly of the opinion that we should probably require that users are registered before being allowed to post on the site. I've noticed that, at least over the past few weeks, a significant percentage of trivial questions (and most of the low-quality answers) have been posted by unregistered users. Yannis mentioned that this might be possible in a <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/40210587#40210587"">discussion on chat</a>. There are certainly pros and cons to preventing unregistered users from posting, and many of these have been pointed out on <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/243712/post-as-guest-is-a-bad-user-experience-and-encourages-low-quality-contribution"">SE:Meta</a>. I may post separately about that to start a discussion.]</p>

<hr>

<p>Having said all that, I think that defining a ""trivial question"" is going to be a non-trivial problem.</p>

<p>It almost goes without saying that every problem is trivial if you already know the answer. However, sometimes you need to have quite specific knowledge in order to frame the question, as with <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/39729/when-the-british-left-india-who-authorized-standstill-agreements-between-karnat"">this question</a> about the standstill agreements between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. In those cases, if you have that knowledge then the question is, indeed, trivial. Otherwise, it can be really difficult to find the answer. I would argue that questions of this type should actually be encouraged, provided that they are otherwise on-topic.</p>

<p>Now, of course questions like ""What was G Washington's first name?"" are going to be caught by any reasonable test for trivia. </p>

<p>I think that your answer to the linked question <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/756/what-are-the-criteria-for-a-trivial-question"">What are the criteria for a “trivial” question?</a> could provide a useful basis for a ""trivia-test"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""If I'm not sure whether a question is trivial, I copy the question,
  paste it into Google and look at the first five answers. If that
  amount of research reveals an answer, then the question is quite
  probably trivial. It suggests that OP didn't do any real research
  before posting the question.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ideally, I'd expand this to include ""<em>multiple mutually-corroborative answers, that aren't all copy-pasted versions of the same Wikipedia article!</em>"", but I think you've given us a good starting point.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm less convinced by the argument that if we get it wrong, and close a question that wasn't trivial, we can always re-open it. My <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3500/24858"">experience</a> in getting a question that was incorrectly closed re-opened hasn't exactly filled me with confidence in the process.</p>

<p>Because of that, I think that I may be more inclined to caution when it comes to closing questions.</p>

<p>In the particular case of questions that can be simply answered by reading Wikipedia articles, if I'm not already familiar with he subject matter, I'll try checking the references in the article and also searching other sites for confirmation.</p>

<p>If I think that if consulting Wikipedia alone would result in an erroneous answer, and if providing an accurate answer here ""requires some skill and subtlety"", then @NeMo is absolutely right. The question is not as trivial as it may have initially appeared, and - perhaps more importantly - we are not merely duplicating information that already exists on Wikipedia. In such cases, I think the question is probably on-topic and should not be closed.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, you've been using the site a lot longer than I have, and you've therefore had longer to form your opinion. I've certainly noticed some aspects about the site that concern me, and I absolutely agree that we need to tackle the issue of trivial questions. I'm just not at all sure about the best way to achieve that.</p>

<p>It's probably also worth noting a distinction between a trivial question and a trivia question. To my mind, a trivial question is one where the answer is easily found and while a trivia question is one where the answer has little historical consequence or importance. Both seem to be candidates for deletion for these reasons.</p>

<p>A trivial question may also be a trivia question, and vice versa, but it's also possible that a trivia question might have a non-trivial answer (e.g. ""what are the names of Churchill's childhood pets?"") and I've seen people defend their questions based on this. However, to me, the fact that the answer is difficult to find (i.e. it's non-trivial) doesn't make it an acceptable question because the answer is still, ultimately, just trivia.</p>

<li>On a modern brooch, ""bow"" can also refer to a ribbon (or representation of a

<p>I suspect that the first question might <em>just</em> be on-topic here. While it is trivial for me to answer, it might not be for someone who doesn't know to search for ""fibula"" in the context of a brooch.</p>

<p>I think the second might be considered off-topic, but then we are back to the question of do people know what a ""fibula"" is in this context.</p>

<p>I would certainly argue that the third question was on-topic. The specific use of the terms in archaeology - and by extension in historical articles and journals - differs from common modern usage. Provided that it made explicit reference to an historical or archaeological context (e.g. the UK Portable Antiquities Scheme), I think that this would be <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">on-topic</a> here.</p>

<hr>

<p>To clarify my answer to the third question above (since the comments below seem to indicate some confusion) consider the example of an escutcheon plate on a lock:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PyHqw.jpg"" alt=""simple escutcheon""></p>

<p>The function of an escutcheon plate is obvious - it protects the wood around a keyhole from damage when keys are repeatedly entered and removed from the keyhole. They are particularly associated with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warded_lock"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">warded locks</a> and examples have been found in contexts from Ancient Rome and Ancient China. In its simplest form it is just a disk or rectangle of metal with a hole of appropriate size and shape cut into it. Most of us would consider this to be a ""furniture fitting"".</p>

<p>But I suspect that most of us have also seen much more elaborate escutcheon plates, for example:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4eDfv.jpg"" alt=""elaborate escutcheon"">]</p>

<p>This still performs the function of an escutcheon plate, but is also now a decorative item. Is it now a ""furniture fitting"", or a ""furniture mount""? Where should we draw the line?</p>

<p>There is no hard-and-fast rule.</p>

<p><strong>These are just labels used by archaeologists to describe groups of artefacts.</strong> Hopefully all the archaeologists working for a particular unit will be consistent (if that unit actually has guidance that specific!). Failing that, we might hope that each archaeologist would use the terms consistently. When we start talking about archaeologists working in different countries, all bets are off ...!</p>

<p>Modern furniture makers are somewhat indiscriminate in their use of the terms (which, I suspect, was the root of the problem when you asked that question on DIY:SE).</p>

<li><p>Visibility. Maybe you know someone who'd like to hear about it and give their opinion ? A spouse-colleague-child-friend who is in school, teaching at a school, or dean at the same ? A mad billionaire from Texas with a thing for history ? The list does not go on.</p></li>

<p><strong>Current state - Technical:</strong></p>

<p>The active development of borders and relevant contribution &amp; maintenance is on hold until I can get a machine to run postGIS on (I am currently borrowing a client's Geoserver to fetch the borders).</p>

<p>Battle/tactical maps. After sifting through a LOT of very heterogeneous material I have decided to make a bit of ad hoc middleware, the purpose of which will be to represent the movement and actions of armies, troops, selected individuals across a time span, in a homogeneously readable way - while at the same time making it possible for users to provide content with consistency.<br>
Since my Big Demo milestone is based on recreating 1 choice event - I am thinking the very beginning of WW2, but I'd like to take suggestions - this is the current Priority I Can Work At.</p>

<p><strong>Current state - Other and plans:</strong></p>

<p>In the last few days I have looked at a lot of official maps, artist's interpretations, publicly posted KMLs with vastly varied data, and read more about the invasion of Poland than I thought I ever would or should. What I gathered confirmed my impression that while a great wealth of information is available, it is in such a fragmented way that it is far less useful than it could be. In short, I believe there is a place for this initiative.</p>

<p>Following the Big Demo, and with an easy to understand ""episode"" to display, I intend to (attempt to) begin contacting a few universities and institutions nearby (I am in Rome) for feedback and/or cohoperation.</p>

<p>In the spirit of glasnost, I wish to clarify that I also intend, for obvious reasons, to showcase the initiative on patreon, kickstarter and whatever else as soon as I get around to understanding how they work.</p>

<p>As pointed out by @axsvl77, we have had a <em>lot</em> of these questions, one repeated the same question over and over for about a week, and just waited to engage anyone who would comment. Patterns begin to emerge after a while. Questions often try to debate the different casualty figures, or the logistics of gas production or train transport, or cost involved.  We have seen these so many times that response for some of us is almost 'knee jerk' to flag and close.  If you think something is legit, don't downvote it, answer it, or at least research it first. You may find if you try to google these topics, they will lead to hate sites. That's your biggest hint.  </p>

<p>As to downvoting sensitive topics, you might note the current <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/40923/how-young-were-children-left-alive-in-auschwitz"">Holocaust question</a> on children, which didn't get closed(yet), <em>because</em> it was  written so as to define the issue; where the question arises from and why its confusing. How the question is written is key. If a legit question arises, this group in general is usually capable of discerning it. And equally capable of sniffing out the Trolls.</p>

<p>If you do feel we are being unfair in closing something, absolutely bring attention to it, debate it, do your own research, comment on or answer the question. That's how the system works best. But we do still have to deal with Trolls and bad questions and answers, so the 'be nice' philosophy does have to have its limits, and down votes, flags and closes <em>will</em> have to happen in some cases.</p>

<p>The question is <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/37974/24858"">Why did the United States want to “make Europe prosperous once more” with the Marshall Plan?</a></p>

<p>As originally posted, the question certainly did appear to reflect a certain bias, and this was noted in the comments. However, based on the OP's later comments in response to <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/37976/24858"">my answer</a>, I realised that it was actually probably just a question of language, rather than bias. It is all-too-easy for someone whose first language isn't English to equate the terms ""self-interest"" and ""selfishness"". I edited the question accordingly.</p>

<p>I have been meaning to add a link to the appropriate volume of the Congressional Record, so that the OP (and any others who are interested) to read the official record of the debates on the Act in Congress (especially since, in the context of self-interest, it is illustrative to note how often senators mention specific benefits to their home states when discussing the Marshall Plan).</p>

<p>Because of other distractions (and the fact that the search tools on archive.org aren't really geared to multi-volume publications like the Congressional Record), it took me a while to find a publicly accessible link to the right volume. When I did eventually get around to it, the question had a re-open vote, so I thought that I would wait and see what happened.</p>

<p>Now, as the question currently stands, I would say that it is clearly ""<em>a specific problem with enough detail to identify an adequate answer</em>"" (as required in the help centre). Despite this, two-thirds of those who voted said that it should remain closed.</p>

<p>Now, it may be that they feel that the question should remain closed for other reasons. Those reasons may be entirely valid, but they are not recorded. In a case like this, <strong><em>how can an OP be expected to improve their question if they don't know why it was closed</em></strong>?</p>

<p>So yes, based on this, and my experience of trying to get a question that was <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3500/24858"">incorrectly closed as a duplicate</a> reopened, I'd say that closure does indeed seem to be a trapdoor function.</p>

<p>That said, I would say ""YES"" to <em>specific</em> questions regarding the historical significance of a <em>particular</em> fashion or furniture item.  Having meaningful ""context"" is everything when dealing with history.</p>

<p>Basically, I would like to see the site discourage ""ID"" or ""fishing"" questions, while allowing conceptual questions regarding the same items. So a question like ""What is the difference between a furniture fitting and a furniture mount? would be off topic. This might even be better for an English language site because it is a ""terminology"" question.

<p>In particular, try hard to treat each comment as an honest attempt to improve what you wrote. This is one I will admit to struggling with. When you spend time writing something, its pretty natural to instinctively growl when you see it being attacked. Its <em>work</em> to turn off that lizard brain and accept what people are seeing that you didn't see in your head when you were typing it.</p>

<p>But of course if a user sees you aggressively pushing back on other users in your posts comments, they'll think twice before voicing their objection. This goes for the content of your post too. If you use aggressive or judgmental language in your post, its pretty clear to voters how you are amped up to react to a critical comment.

<p>Too many of your Writers rely on Wikipedia for historical evidence. Wikipedia is a good source, however, it is very limited in its accuracy and reliability, in large part, because it is unedited or poorly edited. I would suggest to the History Stack Exchange that if a person routinely and frequently cites Wikipedia as his or her main source of historical evidence that he or she should not necessarily receive an ""up vote"", though they do not have to automatically receive ""a down vote"" either.

<hr>

<p>The most recent question <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/41897/did-saint-george-actually-slay-the-dragon"">Did Saint George actually slay the Dragon?</a> was put on-hold for being off-topic. I was one of those who voted to close the question, and my reason was simple. This is a question about mythology, and that is explicitly off-topic, as defined in the Help Centre:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is not about:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Genealogy</li>
  <li>Asking for reference material</li>
  <li>Questions answered by a simple Google search or to be found in a    Wikipedia page</li>

  <li><strong>Mythology</strong></li>
  <li>General (non-human) Prehistory</li>
  <li>Conspiracy Theories or Pseudo-science</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>(my emphasis)</p>

<p>Furthermore, the question includes an assertion (unsupported by any sources):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Now I haven't exactly stumbled upon any dragon skeletons lately, yet, the tale of Saint George and the slain dragon is still viewed by percentages of Christian Theists to have been an actual historical and miraculous event"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then finally, the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Is there anyone within this site who believes - (or better yet, who can prove with the supplying of archaeological and skeletal evidence) that Saint George actually killed a Dragon?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, to paraphrase: ""Is there anyone here who believes, or can prove, this myth is true"".</p>

<p>Which isn't a question that is on-topic for this site, as the present guidelines on the Help Centre make clear.</p>

<hr>

<p>The question before that was <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/41881/was-arabic-the-lingua-franca-of-the-middle-ages"">Was Arabic the “Lingua Franca” of the Middle Ages?</a>. The answer here is actually straightforward. A <em>Lingua Franca</em> is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/u7oQW.png"" alt=""Lingua Franca - OED""></p>

<p>Clearly, Arabic was <strong><em>a</em></strong> <em>lingua franca</em> in the Middle Ages, but not <strong><em>the</em></strong> <em>lingua franca</em> of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>There is a Wikipedia page on the subject, which includes a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lingua_francas"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">List of lingua francas</a>. Now, I get from your question that you aren't a big fan of Wikipedia. However, the Help Centre makes it clear that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""<em>Requests for trivia or basic historical facts are off-topic if they can be easily answered by looking up the relevant topic on Wikipedia. We're trying to complement common historical references, not duplicate them.</em>""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I've only been using this site for about 6 months, so I wasn't involved in drawing up the rules. However, this is one that I agree with completely. (I do wish that it was applied correctly though. Too often, questions are closed for being trivial when they cannot, in fact, be easily answered with a simple Google search or by looking up the relevant topic on Wikipedia. However, that is a different question).</p>

<p>If you believe that the relevant entry on Wikipedia is wrong, incomplete, or misleading (which it may well be) then you need to show that in your question. Ideally, that point should be supported by sources.</p>

<p>All this was pointed out to you in the comments, together with the suggestion that you should edit your question so that it fit with the guidelines. You declined to do so, and the question was closed.</p>

<p>Your next question was <a href=""http://What%20is%20the%20most%20historic%20hotel%20in%20the%20United%20States?"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">What is the most historic hotel in the United States?</a>.</p>

<p>The obvious question to ask here was ""How do you quantify <em>most historic</em>""?</p>

<p>You haven't provided any criteria to measure against, so any answer will be based on opinion. Now that isn't necessarily a bad thing in general, and might be a great question for a debate on <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1560/the-time-machine"">chat</a>, but it is once again expressly off-topic according to the guidelines in the Help Centre:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>avoid asking subjective questions where ... every answer is equally valid: “What’s your favorite ______?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, not all subjective questions are considered to be off-topic. It is worth reading the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/09/29/good-subjective-bad-subjective/"">guidelines for great subjective questions</a>.</p>

<p>Your next question was <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/41845/who-coined-the-phrase-the-pillars-of-hercules"">Who coined the phrase, “The Pillars of Hercules”?</a>. It's undoubtedly an interesting question, but - once again - it is one that is answered on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars_of_Hercules"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""A lost passage of Pindar quoted by Strabo was the earliest traceable reference in this context.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, as noted above, the question is off-topic here.</p>

<p>If you have reason to believe that Wikipedia is wrong, and that there is an earlier reference to the term than the passage by Pindar, quoted by Strabo, the you should include that information (with sources) in your question. In that case, and in my opinion, your question would have been entirely on-topic.</p>

<hr>

<p>Next we had <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/41844/when-does-the-modern-age-end-and-the-contemporary-post-modern-age-begin"">When does the Modern Age end and the Contemporary/Post-Modern Age begin?</a></p>

However, as others had shown with their answers to that question, there is no generally agreed consensus to the definitions, so answers would tend to be based on opinions.</p>

<p>Once again, people suggested that editing the question to clarify your definitions might salvage the question. Once again, you declined to do so, and once again the question was closed.</p>

<h2>Wikipedia</h2>

<p>I agree that one must be cautious about using Wikipedia. There have been a number of studies concerned with the reliability of the content. A few examples are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1772943"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">On measuring the quality of Wikipedia articles</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1822293"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Assigning trust to Wikipedia content</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4782868/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A Brief Review of Studies of Wikipedia in Peer-Reviewed Journals</a></li>
</ul>

<p>(These particular examples are all behind paywalls, but I'm sure that a Google search will turn up other, similar, articles which will doubtless make the same points)</p>

<p>Personally, I am generally quite relaxed about using it to provide links to the pages for people mentioned in my answers, since this is mainly to provide background detail for people unfamiliar with the subject or person.</p>

<p>For example, in my answer to the question <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/39934/24858"">Why did the Germans spare Allied troops trapped at Dunkirk?</a>, I've tried to link to all the Wikipedia pages for the individuals mentioned in my answer. These are not essential details, but simply background information to help those unfamiliar with the <em>dramatis personae</em>.</p>

<p>I'm also generally happy to provide links to Wikipedia for uncontentious topics, although with a note of caution that you didn't mention. While the URL to the Wikipedia page shouldn't change, the content of that page might. Almost anyone can edit Wikipedia - it is, in its <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">own words</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers who write without pay. Anyone with Internet access can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You might link to a page with content that is uncontentious, and which provides the mainstream view about a topic, a future edit may change that.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, for things like the British Expeditionary Force, and the background to the Dunkirk evacuation itself which I also mentioned in my answer above the Wikipedia pages again provide useful background for those less-familiar with the subject.</p>

<p>However, for the documents that provide the main sources for my answer (the diaries of General Halder, the note from Major-General Alfred Jodl to labour minister Robert Ley, etc.) I prefer to link to online, digitised versions of the original documents where possible.</p>

<p>Now, Wikipedia is getting better at providing sources for its content, but it is a slow process (see the reviews in the academic journals listed above). Wikipedia is still no substitute for proper peer-reviewed sources. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, many of the journals containing those sources are now only available online behind a paywall. I was challenged about this when I provided links to this type of site in some of my early answers (I pay for access to the relevant sites because I need them for research).</p>

<p>That seems to me to be a reasonable complaint. The point of linking to the source is to support the assertions we make in our questions and answers. If others can't read those sources, then how do they know we are quoting them correctly? How can they follow up on the answer and take their research further? </p>

<p>It is also clearly going to be extremely frustrating to have to search for alternatives (as you may have now experienced yourself in the case of the journal articles I cited above)!</p>

<p>On other questions, I have used books from my own 'library' as the source for my answer. I'm lucky in that regard. I own quite a lot of books. Unfortunately, while books are wonderful things, they can be difficult to share online. Often, those books are also available on Google Books, but Sods-Law dictates that the preview doesn't include the relevant pages.</p>

<p>I have often spent longer looking for decent online sources to support the points in my answer than I spent on writing the answer itself. [If anyone is interested, I've found archive.org to be a very useful resource in that regard. In particular, they have a complete series of the Congressional Record which is obviously <em>the</em> go-to source for a lot of American political history].</p>

<hr>

<p>However, yes, in the final analysis, sometimes it is just easier to quote Wikipedia.</p>

<p>If the article there is well written (many articles are, despite the criticism you make), and if the [current] content appears to be correct, then I'm reasonable happy to include it as a link in my answer. I would argue that is generally better than providing no supporting source at all.</p>

<p>At least then others can review my source, and challenge it if they feel that it it wrong (hopefully they would also provide alternative sources to support their position). And surely that is, in fact, the main reason for providing supporting sources in the first place.</p>

<p>We are using flesh-based input to operate the sorting algorithm that the voting system is meant create: get the cream/best answer to rise to the top. In some cases, a comment will begin a non-productive back and forth exchange, which degrades site quality by increasing noise with no added signal.  In other cases, a comment will result in what comments are built for: improving the question or answer in play.  </p>

<p>Each person down voting needs to apply their judgment on what they think will be the outcome of a comment for a given question or answer.  Give the users some credit, eh?  </p>

<h2>This SE site, and any other SE site, Isn't A Discussion Forum.</h2>

<p>What that means is that if the answerer or asker does not meet the minimum quality standard outlined in the Help Center, the system is built to provide negative feedback.  While stated in a variety of more flowery terms (see Be Nice rules), the message that needs to be sent clearly is ""No, your input isn't good enough, raise your game.""  A favorable signal to noise ratio requires that kind of feedback to get the quality content the SE system desires.  </p>

<p>I have been seeing your questions and answers, and like that you're now a member of this community. I think over time you'll figure out how to ask. Just keep plugging at it (and review sempasicubas answer, it's pretty helpful I think).</p>

<p>No source is a far larger problem than Wikipedia.   I'm willing to accept Wikipedia sources over posts with no research at all.  Complaining about Wikipedia reminds me of a friend's mother's criticism of someone... ""She'd complain about being hanged with a silk rope.""   Sure, a silk rope would be nicer than a sisal rope, but the hanging is what matters.  Sourceless questions are like being hanged.   Wikipedia is the texture of the rope.</p>

<p>Beyond that, many of the questions we're asked are perfectly appropriate for Wikipedia.  Many of our most valuable questions have to do with erroneous assumptions, or with a total lack of some some precursor knowledge.  Wikipedia is a fine resource to give to somebody when what they need is a high level overview of a topic, or an introduction.   (Ignorance is not a sin;  Ignorance expressed in the form of a question is virtuous.)</p>

<p>That said, I admire your persistence and tenacity.  In my personal opinion, many of the questions were too subjective, but I'm just one vote.  New members are far more valuable than the community agreeing with my preferences.

<hr>

<p>I'll be honest here. My first reaction upon seeing my name here was to echo William Tecumsah Sherman's response when he was asked about the 1884 Presidential election!</p>

<p>I am honoured (and not a little surprised) to have been nominated. However, I do worry that my appointment would have a divisive, rather than a cohesive, effect on the community (I think the pattern of voting so far makes that point quite clear).</p>

<p>That said, the fact that I am in the UK (the <a href=""https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/TimeZone.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UT timezone</a>) would certainly help maintain a fast response to concerns flagged by the community, and help in the struggle against ""<em>the international Nazi/troll conspiracy to destroy the internet</em>"" mentioned by @T.E.D. in the comments above.</p>

<p>I accept this nomination</p>

<p>Hi, I am Iain and I live in the east end of London in dear old Blighty.</p>

<p>I'm fairly new to the Stack Exchange community, having been a member for just over six months. I still don't really get the idea of motivation by reputation scores and badges (which probably amounts to heresy on SE, I know!).</p>

<p>In that time, I've been fairly active on the site, both in terms of answering questions and carrying out the site self-moderation tasks from the Review queues. I do feel quite strongly that we are often not sufficiently supportive towards new users of the site. This is something which I have tried to argue for on meta in the past, and something that I will continue to argue for in the future - irrespective of whether I am appointed as a moderator.</p>

<p>If this site is to grow to maturity, then we need new users, and those users will often need a little extra support to get used to the rules of the community.</p>

<p>Beyond that, there is a little more background about me in my <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/users/24858/"">profile bio</a>. If anyone would like to know more, please feel free to ask.</p>

<p>I've not been using SE as long as you have, but I'm not convinced that it's a good idea to allow unregistered users to suggest edits to content on this site, or indeed to post questions or answers.</p>

<p>I mentioned this latter point in passing in an <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3538/24858"">answer</a> to another question here on meta:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... I'm becoming increasingly of the opinion that we should probably require that users are registered before being allowed to post on the site. I've noticed that, at least over the past few weeks, a significant percentage of trivial questions (and most of the low-quality answers) have been posted by unregistered users. Yannis mentioned that this might be possible in a <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/40210587#40210587"">discussion on chat</a>. There are certainly pros and cons to preventing unregistered users from posting, and many of these have been pointed out on <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/243712/post-as-guest-is-a-bad-user-experience-and-encourages-low-quality-contribution"">SE:Meta</a> ...</p>

<hr>

<p>The advantage to allowing anonymous users to suggest edits is that mistakes are more likely to be picked up with a wider pool of potential editors. The disadvantage is that, as you point out, many of those edits will be either vandalism or just very low quality. There was some discussion about whether anonymous edits are helpful about 5 years ago on <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/120849/do-we-have-stats-showing-that-anonymous-edits-are-helpful"">SE:meta</a>, but I can't see anything more recent.</p>

<p>However, the number of suggested edits on H.SE is still quite low, and those made by anonymous visitors even fewer.

<p>A bad ""why didn't"" question is something like ""Why didn't the sun fail to rise today?"" That is a question in a vacuum, and there is no motivation for it.

It has one case, Hong Kong, that demonstrates that the question's premise is possible, and then ask why certain things happened there, and not Gibraltar; what were the differences between the two cases. There are some superficial similarities between Hong and Gibraltar. They were both strategically located, and both controlled by Britain, a Maritime power. Things just developed differently historically; e.g. Hong Kong, although ""small"" on both counts, ended up with a land area and population more than 100 times greater than Gibraltar. There were other important differences in the immediate environment. True, the question demonstrates a certain factual ignorance, but this, unlike e.g. ignorance of History SE protocol, isn't anything to be ashamed of.</p>

(1) the number of applicable questions is very low: there's really just a couple. (2) you can basically get the same result just by searching for Schleswig and Holstein. (3) For most of history Shleswig and Holstein were separate duchies and there's not much reason to consider them jointly except for one topic, namely the Schleswig-Holstein Question.</p>

<p>Tags are very helpful in unifying multiple search terms. For example, a WW2 question may only refer to a date, or say ""WW2"", or ""Second World War"", or just say ""Hitler / Nazi Germany"". With the popularity of WW2 questions, the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/second-world-war"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;second-world-war&#39;"" rel=""tag"">second-world-war</a> tag is very convenient because it helps bring all of these under one search.</p>

<p>For Schleswig-Holstein, it seems rather more convenient to simply search for the region by name. It is almost unavoidable that any such question will mention the area's name. Combined with a low number of questions, the utility of this tag becomes reduced. And in fact the modern German state of Schleswig-Holstein is mostly just Holstein anyway.</p>

<p>The real problem is that <strong>questions are limited to only five tags</strong>. The example question in the OP had already hit this limit with <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/nazi-germany"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;nazi-germany&#39;"" rel=""tag"">nazi-germany</a>, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/world-war-one"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;world-war-one&#39;"" rel=""tag"">world-war-one</a>, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hitler"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;hitler&#39;"" rel=""tag"">hitler</a>, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/denmark"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;denmark&#39;"" rel=""tag"">denmark</a>, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/border-dispute"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;border-dispute&#39;"" rel=""tag"">border-dispute</a>. Yet there's still more applicable tags, including <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/international-relations"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;international-relations&#39;"" rel=""tag"">international-relations</a>, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/versailes"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;versailes&#39;"" rel=""tag"">versailes</a>, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/world-war-two"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;world-war-two&#39;"" rel=""tag"">world-war-two</a> and <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/interwar"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;interwar&#39;"" rel=""tag"">interwar</a>. Suppose one replaces the Denmark tag with a Shleswig-Holstein tag. This actually reduces the utility of the Denmark tag, by removing a question you'd expect to find with it.</p>

<p>It's not just about geographic tags, by the way; dividing temporal and other categorical tags too finely causes the same downside. Instead of doing one search to find all [x] question, one would have to search twice. Of course this isn't always a bad thing. If there's large number of questions, then it may be a net bonus to organisation. But for only a handful of questions, not so much.</p>

<p>Like I said, I'm not actually opposed to regional tags. Scotland for instance is definitely a good tag to use. It's just that given the highly limited real estate for tags (only five), I believe it is more prudent to be judicious.</p>

<ol>
<li>Do we think no answer at all is better than a poor/partial answer in the comments?</li>
<li>Do we think poor/partial answers is better than having the same in comments?</li>
</ol>

<p>Two of the usual reason that Stackexchange does not like answers in comments is that comments are ephemeral and may be deleted. But this can also be an advantage.</p>

<p>History.SE attracts a lot of complex, multipart questions. It's perhaps the nature of the subject that people tend to have interlocked queries, and post them as one. For example, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/42401/4935"">this</a> contains two main questions and four subsidiary ones. Often people might know about or only have time to elaborate on a specific part. If they were to share this knowledge, then we'll either get partial answers in the comments, or incomplete answers as a reply.</p>

<p>Similarly, it's not rare to see questions that are misinformed or confused about certain critical details. Often a quick clarification could assist the asker in identifying the real question of interest. Again, this could be a partial answer in the comments that clears up a specific part of the question, or an incomplete answer that may easily be rendered irrelvant if the asker were to edit their question to improve its quality.</p>

<p>Given the choices, I believe comments are superior because they don't clutter the thread with partial answers. It takes less time and effort, and doesn't come with the risk of being penalised with downvotes, therefore we encourage more participation and exchange of information. Lastly, and this is where the ephemeral nature of comments come in handy - these can be deleted without much impact.</p>

<p>As an addendum, I would suggest that discussion comment chains should generally be moved into chat with a corresponding link left in the comments, rather than deleted completely.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another scenario is trivial questions, which H.SE maintains a policy of closing. It's often easy to explain why such questions should be closed by answering it, which I believe is superior to leaving the asker in the dark. These <em>could</em> be posted as full answers, but in the common case where the answer is a Wikipedia article, the standing consensus is that we do not want to duplicate Wikipedia, but also that link only answers are not allowed. That leaves comments.</p>

<p>Yes, when I field a flag for a comment, I look at <em>all</em> the other comments on the same post.</p>

<p>For one thing, sometimes a person simply doesn't like what a comment has to say and wants to trick me into deleting it. I'm looking for that.</p>

<p>Other times, the comment may have become obsolete, so I'll check to see if the post has since been edited in a way that essentially surrendered to the comment. In that case, the comment should go.</p>

<p>Other times, the comment is chatty. Usually this will trigger a move to chat, and deletion of it, all other chatty comments, and all comments in the same conversation.</p>

<p>Sometimes the comment is ""not nice"". In that case it gets deleted, responses to it get deleted, and any less-than-fully-nice comments leading up to it get deleted.</p>

<p>And sometimes it is just such a huge mess that I'll ""declare comment bankruptcy"" and delete them all. If I can move them to chat first, I might.</p>

<hr>

<p>That being said, if some injustice is done to a comment, well that's the way the cookie crumbles. Comments aren't our product here, questions and answers are. Don't expect comments to last forever.</p>

<p>I once had a friend who made a distinction between ""house cats"" and ""barn cats"". House cats are pets you care for. Barn cats can be cute and helpful with pest control, but they have all sorts of misfortunes befall them; stepped on by livestock, eaten by wildlife, run over, threshed, baled up, etc. That's just life. You don't get attached to them.</p>

My question is not asking about trivia. It's questioning an assertion and even tries to provide some evidence to back it up. I've shown research effort, I explained clearly what I'm looking for, and I have provided some clues that a statement that has been accepted for a long time might be wrong. It's true that <strong>a good answer would need research effort</strong> as well, but that's what we are here for. So I was led to believe.</p>

<p>Then again, a biased answer which showed only one's ""opinion"", <strong>no research effort at all</strong>, and provided no links sources, or references, was not criticezed at all and was even upvoted.

",Why was my first question here on History Stack Exchange put on hold?,3632,1,3,,CC BY-SA 3.0
,3632,,,,2017-12-24T14:02:30.777,1401,5,,2017-12-24T14:02:30.777,,,,,,"<p>Close options are limited - we only get five choices; if we choose to close a question, we have to fit the reason into one of five boxes.  So there is some inherent imprecision.  When the closure reason doesn't seem to match the facts, we have to look deeper to figure out why people voted to close.</p>

<p>At first glance, I think your question is legitimate. I'm going to re-read the question and the comments and the answers before I act, and I may wait and listen to some other people's opinions, but prima facia, I think it is a legit question.  Having said that, this may also be a case where closure provides an opportunity to revise a question and re-open it to everyone's benefit.  There are a couple of anti-patterns in your question that are detracting from the evaluation of the question.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>I suspect that the largest contributor to the problem was the misunderstanding of how you were defining ""largest"".  You clarified this in the edit, but I <em>suspect</em> that some damage had already been done.   Before a vote to re-open, I recommend that you move that edit from a postscript to the first sentence.  I think if we make that explicit we will resolve much of the problem.  </p></li>
<li><p>""well researched"" - Reviewing the entire issue, it is clear to me that you have researched this question and that you know your stuff.  Reading the question alone, that is less clear.  I think if the clarifications in the comments had been edited into the question, everyone would agree that it is well researched. But I also believe that the requests for clarification in the comments were legitimate.  The first draft of the question didn't make it clear that you were asking about land area.  It wasn't clear that you were talking about the Iberian Empire rather than the Spanish Empire.  I think that if you edit the question as @LangLangC requested, it will resolve the problem.  Define ""largest"", define ""Iberian Empire"" (and link to a reference), define the time period to which you refer.  You've done most of this in comments, but if it is moved to the question and organized, I think the problem will be resolved. </p></li>
<li><p>When someone offers a Wikipedia page in the comments, the question is very likely to be closed as trivial.  That indicates that we, the community, don't understand why the Wikipedia page doesn't answer the question.  I think if you can provide that information in the question in a somewhat more neutral tone than is currently in the comments, the problem will be resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>""<em>I'm asking this question because it seems to me that the Iberian Empire, under Phillip II, a Habsburg, was far larger.""</em> - very closely fits the ""I think X amiright?"" anti-pattern from the help center.  Those anti-patterns in the help center record the community experience over time, and questions that are similar to those anti-patterns are going to inherit some community qualms - there is subconcious ""what, this sounds like all those questions that...""  In this case, this question <em>resembles</em> questions that are argumentative and trivial.  People are very good at pattern recognition - even when the pattern is a false one - and subjectively will begin to react to the pattern.   I think that some minor editing to the word choices in the question will convey much more effectively that you are looking for an objective answer based on an objective measurement.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use of the word ""seems"" reinforces the impression of subjectivity.  I think I get why you chose that word, but I also think I get why other people were uncomfortable.  Again, minor editing will eliminate this problem.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't want to be argumentative, but I do want to provide feedback - I will admit that when I personally read the question, I was tempted to hit the trivial button because ""largest land mass"" seems like a trivial measurement to me.  There are infinite numbers of ways to measure an empire - some are standard (GDP), and some are positively silly (number of left handed blue eyed people named ""lars"").  ""largest land mass"" doesn't seem to help me to understand Empires or Imperialism, or anything else.  I am not saying it is illegitimate, but it reinforces the other impressions of that sentence.  If you can explain why this measurement matters it will help; if not, I think that resolving the other problems will address this.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Multiple argumentative comments. Based on years of participation in the site, I have observed that when OP's comments are argumentative, the question is in trouble. Comments are (usually/supposed to be) requests for clarification. When OP responds in comments, things devolve into arguments and tit for tat, and nobody gets any joy. I advise OP's not to respond in comments, but to edit the question.   I believe that if you edit the question to incorporate the substantive points in the comments, and I purge the comments, this problem will vanish. </p></li>
<li><p>missed opportunity.  In the comment stream you say, ""f you consider Spanish possessions in South America, Brazil, and The Viceroyalty of New Spain together, there was a time when the Iberian Empire covered an area of perhaps 34.000.000 km² in the Americas alone"" - If you edit that into the question, this will be resoved.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I don't think there is a single, clear empirical reason why the question was closed. I think it was a combination of factors.  I've tried to indicated how those factors could be resolved.  I think the fundamental question is legitimate, and could be edited into re-open fairly easily. It is early and I haven't had enough caffeine yet today; if I've misunderstood the problem, please let me know.  I think I speak for all of us in affirming that we do want to welcome new members, particularly those who have researched and thought through the problem deeply before asking.</p>

<p>In all honesty I'd vote to close its updated version if I could. The reason is that going by claim rather than colonial control proper makes the question a request for trivia or worse. A claim is worthless if you're unable to enforce it - at gun point if needs be.</p>

<p>Writing or editing <em>short</em> posts in a browser has certain advantages if they should go straight up here on this site. But there are also certain disadvantages that get worse when the posts in questions or answers are getting longer. As soon as you have to expand the editor box things get ugly fast.</p>
<p>Are long answers bad? If you have to provide sources or quotes, like on this site, length grows quickly without much written by yourself. And I remember one of the preformed critique sound-bytes that sometimes appear under SE posts: &quot;We expect longer answer, that…&quot;</p>
<p>Sometimes I am under the impression that two paragraph answers without sources or links appeared on this site and to me that indicated mostly a quite trivial question yielding trivial answers. While I sometimes struggle to really keep it short, I really try to constrain myself. (Is there a general guideline or recent discussion I overlooked on how to orient yourself, lengthwise in an answer?)</p>
<p>Here, on a site that benefits from at least slightly longer answers, the default browser edit-field is way too small to fit just three proper paragraphs into it. As soon as the editor/writer has to scroll, keeping an eye on structure and layout is simply terrible. If it would at least live-render in side by side mode. Way to many of my edits are because I overlooked something basic, lost orientation in my own text or just wanted to prevent loosing the text.</p>
<p>Offline composing with <em>any</em> editor available that live-renders markdown and only posting the final result when all links and pictures and any formatting quirks are dealt with seems like a better way to go. If it isn't, please correct me. For example if I overlooked a browser configuration or extension?</p>
<p>I've looked into <em>several</em> editors that run on Apple hardware – I also searched for software that does a tiny bit of what I am asking here before — (also in questions on this SE). What came closest so far: I more or less chose to explore <a href=""http://macdown.uranusjr.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MacDown</a> for a quite nice two pane view of source and rendered output. This enables the writer to theoretically write everything offline and then just post the final text on this site. But the downsides to this are the following:</p>
<h3>Shortcomings of the current browser editor as is:</h3>
<ul>
<li>the editing capabilities of this site are optimized for really short posts, your own overview of what's going to be rendered soon requires a lot of scrolling (at least the scrolling mess can be mitigated a bit with this userscript <a href=""https://stackapps.com/questions/6461/side-by-side-editing"">side-by-side-editing</a>)</li>
<li>browsers used for editing introduce a dependence on internet access (for just writing something this should be superfluous)</li>
<li>browsers tend to crash a lot more than simpler editors: with online dependence, draft saving make your work a lot more volatile that way (I recently read in a comment &quot;the internet ate my answer…&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Shortcomings of my offline editor:</h3>

I assume a little more wait until one proposal gets at least 3x votes than the closest one ought to do the trick to reflect the community consensus properly.

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Britain</strong> is an ambiguous term that can mean Great Britain the island, or the United Kingdom, or the Kingdom of Great Britain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Great Britain</strong> is ambiguous term that can mean either the island or the kingdom.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/tagging"">The purpose of tags is to sort questions into useful categories.</a>. This means that tags should strike a balance <strong>between specificity and generality</strong>, and ideally be relatively unambiguous and intuitive to use. While editing the excerpts can help, the reality is that most people don't bother reading them. Case in point, right now <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/britain"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;britain&#39;"" rel=""tag"">britain</a> contains questions including the Kingdom of Great Britain, the United Kingdom, the British Empire, <em>and</em> the island of Great Britain.</p>

<p>So, my proposal is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>create a new tag <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/british-isles"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;british-isles&#39;"" rel=""tag"">british-isles</a>:</strong> This has the great advantage of being an unambiguously geographical and well understood term, unlike <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/great-britain"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;great-britain&#39;"" rel=""tag"">great-britain</a> which is both an island and a kingdom. The British Isles taken as a whole is also reasonably sized for a general regional tag, since we already have <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ireland"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ireland&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ireland</a>, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scotland"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;scotland&#39;"" rel=""tag"">scotland</a>, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/wales"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;wales&#39;"" rel=""tag"">wales</a>, and <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/england"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;england&#39;"" rel=""tag"">england</a> for more specific questions. <sub>If people are adamantly opposed to grouping Ireland together with the UK, an alternative is <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/british-islands"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;british-islands&#39;"" rel=""tag"">british-islands</a> which exclude Ireland. But in my opinion this is unnecessarily specific.</sub></p></li>
<li><p><strong>make <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/britain"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;britain&#39;"" rel=""tag"">britain</a> a ""synonym"" of <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-kingdom"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;united-kingdom&#39;"" rel=""tag"">united-kingdom</a>:</strong> Because Britain is an ambiguous term with conflicting definitions, it is better to avoid it altogether. I believe the redirect is appropriate because Britain is a common abbreviation for the UK, and <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/33989/what-percentage-of-british-people-during-the-industrial-revolution-were-rich"">many<sup>1</sup></a> <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/37732/how-did-the-british-army-unit-size-and-structure-in-wwi-change-from-1915-to-1918"">existing<sup>2</sup></a> <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/34579/what-does-georgius-iii-dg-britanniarum-rex-fidei-def-c-mean"">questions<sup>3</sup></a> use the tag that way anyway. We can include usage notes in the tag redirecting people to <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/british-isles"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;british-isles&#39;"" rel=""tag"">british-isles</a> or another appropriate tag.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The second question is what to do with <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/great-britain"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;great-britain&#39;"" rel=""tag"">great-britain</a>. We could maintain it as a separate tag for the Kingdom of Great Britain, which is, in theory, the existing usage. In practice, it is frequently misused in confusion with <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-kingdom"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;united-kingdom&#39;"" rel=""tag"">united-kingdom</a> - see below for examples. Evidently this tag is non intuitive for our users, and I would further argue that it is unnecessarily fragmentary. Therefore, my proposal is to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>declare <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-kingdom"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;united-kingdom&#39;"" rel=""tag"">united-kingdom</a> the appropriate tag for the Kingdom of Great Britain:</strong> They are the same polity with an unbroken continuity, separated only by a cosmetic name change. Hence, practically speaking, there's no real benefit to treating them separately. In fact, most of our users don't: <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/42470/what-were-the-motivating-factors-in-the-scottish-highland-clearances"">many<sup>1</sup></a> <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/40515/why-was-prince-philip-given-these-specific-titles-before-marrying-princess-eliza"">existing<sup>2</sup></a> <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/36132/what-is-the-greater-significance-of-the-boer-war"">questions<sup>3</sup></a> tagged <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/great-britain"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;great-britain&#39;"" rel=""tag"">great-britain</a> are actually about the UK, and <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-kingdom+18th-century"">vice versa</a>. Since the Kingdom of Great Britain almost completely overlaps with the 18th century, I propose we simply tag such questions <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/18th-century"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;18th-century&#39;"" rel=""tag"">18th-century</a> and <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-kingdom"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;united-kingdom&#39;"" rel=""tag"">united-kingdom</a>.</li>

<p>Technically at least they could be two different things. <em>Britain</em> is an island, <em>Great Britain</em> is a polity.</p>

<p>Although it excludes Northern Ireland, <em>Great Britain</em> comprises somewhat more than the island of Britain. It includes the Isle of Wight, the Hebrides, Orkneys, Shetlands, Anglesey, and so on.</p>

<p>While negligible in size, the culture of these places is very strong, and diverse both with regard to other and to Britain (England, Scotland and Wales are obviously hetrogenous too, but that's another story).</p>

<p>So, a question could be about <em>Great Britain</em>, but not <em>Britain</em>. Moreover, any question can't be about <em>Great Britain</em> if it deals with events before the 18th century; the Romans, Saxons, Normans etc settled <em>Britain</em>, and <em>Great Britain</em> didn't exist yet.</p>

<p>Division should be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>British Isles</strong>: the whole shebang. British and Irish Isles should be a synonym.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>united-kingdom</strong> for the currently existing country, 1801 onwards. This implies Northern Ireland, Channel Islands, Isle of Man, and others which aren't counted e.g. in GB-only general election results. If before 1922, this means Ireland too.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>great-britain</strong> for questions about British history 1707 onward. People should specify Northern Ireland or Ireland if their question relates to that too, because that's <em>not</em> included in the tag.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>britain</strong> is the island. This should be reserved for ancient history questions, or where it's intended as a geographical term.</p></li>

<p>As I understand it, the function of tags is to allow questions about particular topics or events to be found quickly. As such, we should probably be careful of removing tags which help to find information. The numbers of questions may be relatively small now, but they will hopefully grow as the site grows.</p>

<hr>

<p>In this case, the problem is not a straightforward one, and is complicated by history, geography and politics. The language matters to a lot of people (note the history of nationalism in Ireland, Scotland and Wales!) The following diagram will give some illustration of what I mean:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DgmZ9.png"" alt=""Britain""></p>

<p>And even that does not capture the full complexity! I hope that I don't tread on too may toes in what follows. If I do, I can only apologise and hope that I have only trodden lightly!</p>

<hr>

<p>I think there are logically two ways to look at this if we are going to decide what tags are likely to be needed to capture this complexity: <em>top-down</em> or <em>bottom-up</em>.</p>

<p>I'm going to try a <em>bottom-up</em> approach.</p>

<p>In its modern sense, ""<em>Britain</em>"" is a rather nebulous, often ill-defined term. However, when that term is used the component parts that go to make up the whole will probably be some, or all, of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/england"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;england&#39;"" rel=""tag"">england</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ireland"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ireland&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ireland</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scotland"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;scotland&#39;"" rel=""tag"">scotland</a></li>
<li>Wales</li>
<li>The Isle of Man</li>
<li>The Channel Islands (Guernsey, Jersey, Alderney, Sark, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>When James VI and I succeeded to the throne of England on the death of Elizabeth I in 1603, he had three separate and distinct crowns: the crown of England, the crown of Scotland and the crown of Ireland. The term <em>Great Britain</em> was actually first used during the reign of James VI &amp; I as a kind of shorthand to refer to the (then still separate) Kingdoms of England and Scotland.</p>

<p>The Kingdom of Great Britain was created by the union of the crowns of Scotland and England. The name was defined in the first sections of the <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Ann/6/11/part/1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Union with Scotland Act 1706</a> and the <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aosp/1707/7/section/I"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Union with England Act 1707</a>. </p>

<p>So, for example, the <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Ann/6/11/contents"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1706 Act</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""That the two Kingdoms of England and Scotland shall upon the First day of May which shall be in the year One thousand seven hundred and seven and for ever after be united into one Kingdom by the name of Great Britain""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which left two kingdoms: the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland.</p>

<hr>

<p>On a side-note, Wales had been conquered and occupied by Edward I in the 13th century, and was effectively a colony of England until it was formally annexed through the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_in_Wales_Acts_1535_and_1542"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Laws in Wales Acts 1535 &amp; 1542</a>, which made it a part of the Kingdom of England. This is also why there is no ""Welsh"" component in the union flag:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rZ87m.jpg"" alt=""union flag""></p>

<p>and may also explain why we have relatively few questions explicitly about Wales so far, and don't (yet) have a tag for it.</p>

<hr>

<p>In 1800, the <a href=""http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apgb/Geo3/39-40/67"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Union with Ireland Act</a> united the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland. The act states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""the said kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland shall, upon the first day of January which shall be in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and one, and for ever after, be united into one kingdom, by the name of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The name was amended to the <em>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</em> when southern Ireland became independent of the UK from 1922.</p>

<hr>

<h2>So, what I suggest is the following:</h2>

<p>On the basis of the history set out above, I think it makes sense to retain the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/great-britain"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;great-britain&#39;"" rel=""tag"">great-britain</a> to refer explicitly to events involving the Kingdom of Great Britain, and to create a usage excerpt and summary to reflect that. The <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/britain"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;britain&#39;"" rel=""tag"">britain</a> tag really does not mean the same thing.</p>

<p>The tag <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-kingdom"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;united-kingdom&#39;"" rel=""tag"">united-kingdom</a> should be used to refer to the <em>Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</em> (from 1800 - 1922) and/or the <em>Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</em> (from 1922 - ). The usage excerpt and summary for the tag should be updated to reflect that.</p>

<hr>

<p>Which still leaves us with a couple of problems. The first of these may be illustrated by a couple of examples. How should we tag questions that are explicitly about Roman Britain (distinct from the rest of the Roman Empire), or about post-Roman Britain before the emergence of an entity that was recognisably ""England""?</p>

<p>It is in situations like this where the less-precise term <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/britain"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;britain&#39;"" rel=""tag"">britain</a> may be useful. However, it is probably better to use the unambiguous <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/british-isles"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;british-isles&#39;"" rel=""tag"">british-isles</a>, with an appropriate usage excerpt and summary to make it clear that the function of the tag is a ""catch-all"". We can then maintain <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/britain"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;britain&#39;"" rel=""tag"">britain</a>  as a synonym for <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/british-isles"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;british-isles&#39;"" rel=""tag"">british-isles</a>.</p>

<p>A quick glance at the list of questions tagged <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/britain"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;britain&#39;"" rel=""tag"">britain</a> shows a number that should probably be re-tagged as either <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/great-britain"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;great-britain&#39;"" rel=""tag"">great-britain</a>, (e.g. <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/40609/why-were-british-ships-not-of-the-same-quality-as-french-and-spanish-ships-until"">Why were British ships not of the same quality as French and Spanish ships until the latter part of the 18th century?</a>) or <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-kingdom"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;united-kingdom&#39;"" rel=""tag"">united-kingdom</a> (e.g. <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/39308/how-did-the-crimean-war-change-british-society"">How did the Crimean war change British society?</a>) </p>

<hr>

<p>The other problem is Ireland. We currently have <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ireland"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ireland&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ireland</a> and <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/republic-of-ireland"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;republic-of-ireland&#39;"" rel=""tag"">republic-of-ireland</a>. The former states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The questions may refer to both the island itself and Ireland as a country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the latter currently has only 4 tagged questions.</p>

<p>It may be that we should consider having three tags:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ireland"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ireland&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ireland</a>: for questions referring to the island of Ireland or
the Kingdom of Ireland until 1800</li>

republic of Ireland from 1922</li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/northern-ireland"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;northern-ireland&#39;"" rel=""tag"">northern-ireland</a>: (probably with the tag synonym ""Ulster"") for 
questions about Northern Ireland after 1922.</li>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br>
The official Israeli position is that the 1967 Attack on the USS Liberty was a case of mistaken identity.  That the American ship was previously identified, but then was later confused with an armed Egyptian ship half it's size.  That the American Ship contributed to this Israeli mistake because: (see below excerpts discussing Israeli Court Enquiry).</p>

<p><strong>NSA Report used to support the Israeli Position in my original Question:</strong><br>

  - The USS Liberty was covered with thick smoke.<br>
  - When asked to identify itself the USS Liberty did not do so and acted suspiciously.<br>
  - It appeared to the DivCom that there was a gun on the foredeck of the USS Liberty which was firing towards MTB's.<br>
  - Finally if we add these factors under the circumstances when the ship was completely covered with smoke there was, in fact, apparently a great similarity between it (The 10.7 ton, 455 foot USS Liberty) and the (2.8 ton, 275 foot)El QUSEIR. (Egyptian Gun Boat)</p>

<p>Clearly the US reaction to the Israeli Court Findings as represented in this once classified NSA report,  do not show the United States representatives as supporting the Israeli Court Findings as was originally presented.</p>

<p><strong>Overview of Quotes I Used to Substantiate the Legitimacy of my Question:</strong><br>
At one point my question was called ""conspiracy theory"" and optioned out to the StackExchange:skeptics site.  How can a question with supporting quotes from 20 highly placed senior American sources all in positions of responsibility at the time of the attack be considered ""conspiracy""?  These supporting quotes all expressing doubt as to the Israeli findings:</p>

<ul>
<li>Secretary of State</li>
<li>Under Secretary of State</li>
<li>Chairman of the President's Foreign Advisory Board</li>
<li>General Legal Council for the Department of Defense</li>
<li>Former US Ambassador to Lebanon</li>
<li>Deputy head of the US mission to Cairo</li>
<li>Assistant Secretary of Defense</li>
<li>US Navy JAGC</li>
<li>Director of the CIA</li>
<li>Deputy Director of the CIA</li>
<li>Director of the National Security Agency</li>
<li>3 Deputy directors of NSA </li>
<li>Chief of Operations of the National Security Agency</li>
<li>4 United States Navy Admirals</li>
</ul>

<p>I used a survivors site of the USS Liberty which lists these quotes.  If the objection is I should have gone to the original sources I can provide original sources for each quote.  But none of the quotes themselves were questioned in the exchange on the veracity of the question. </p>

<p><strong>Review of the American Investigations into the Incident</strong>
It was also stated that there were 6 United States inquiries into this attack all of which supported the Israeli findings.   This is just not true, but I could not respond at the time given the question was closed.</p>

<p>The facts are there were 7 times the United States Gov publicly addressed this attack.  3 of them were investigatory bodies.  But none of those investigatory bodies dealt with the scope of Israeli findings for the attack. </p>

<p><strong>Investigative Reports highlighted below</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Paraphrased From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Liberty_incident"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia: USS Liberty incident see US Gov Investigations of Attack.</a><br>
  * <strong><strong>U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry of June 1967</strong></strong>.  Scope limited to US Navy personnel actions before, during and after the attack.   ""It was not the responsibility of the court to rule on the culpability of the attackers, and no evidence was heard from the attacking nation""<br>
  * <strong>Joint Chief of Staff's Report of June</strong> 1967.  Scope limited to Communications failures within the US Navy surrounding the attack.<br>
  * CIA Intelligence Memorandums of June 1967.  Two memo's one laying out sources of information, the other detailing the Israeli courts findings.<br>
  * Clark Clifford Report of July 1967 - says after reviewing all available information, ""The unprovoked attack on the Liberty constitutes a flagrant act of gross negligence for which the Israeli Government should be held completely responsible, and the Israeli military personnel involved should be punished.""<br>
  * Senate Foreign Relations Committee Testimony during hearings of the  1967 Foreign Aid Authorization bill, July 1967.  Comments about the attack while the Senate was dealing with other business.<br>
  * House Armed Services Committee Investigation of 1971 -  ""Review of Department of Defense Worldwide Communications"". Was not an investigation on the attack. Contained a section describing communications during the attack.<br>
  * <strong>The NSA History Report</strong> of 1981 - reviews the court of inquiry and several other documents but provides no conclusion regarding culpability.              </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>First Wording of My Question:</strong>
Why was the USS Liberty Attacked?</p>

<p>Now my original question, may appear to be too broad; however I think there were specific difficulties in the US Israeli relations preceding the event which could be presented as a reasonable response;  Which I would like to attempt.</p>

<p><strong>Second Wording:</strong>
Using The USS Liberty attack, June 8th, 1967 as a fulcrum or pivot what historical events had the most influence on relatively cool relations (as demonstrated using US Foreign Aid to Israel as a metric) prior to 1967, and exponentially improving relations after 1967?</p>

<p>I also tried to change my question to better focus on the events leading up and following the attack rather than the attack itself which is well documented elsewhere.  Using the USS Liberty as a pivotal moment in time between cool relations and exponentially improving relations using US foreign aid as a metric.  There were several comments asking for me to make a new question out of that.  Two questions on my part.  (1) First off is this a more acceptable question?  (2) Why can't we open the existing question given as written the original question asked for reasons for the attack, and was not about the attack itself.  Both question dealt with events leading up to the attack.</p>

<p><strong>Solicitations for Ideas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Could this topic be a legitimate one for a question? Or Not?

<ul>
<li>My contention is given how many senior people on the US side express doubt on the Israeli position and the age almost 55 years ago.  This is a legitimate history question.  Granted a controversial one.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can I re-word my question to make it more legitimate?</li>
<li>Perhaps someone can make the case this is not a legitimate topic as it's not settled history, given the NSA is still releasing classified information on this event?</li>
<li>Perhaps it is felt this topic is too controversial for this board? </li>
</ul>

What follows are my own opinions, please ignore any diamond you might see attached to my name!</p>

<hr>

<p>I think the original version of the question was probably actually on-topic, but should have been worded better. The series of edits that followed is probably what made people think that you were arguing for a conspiracy theory, and suggested the topic would be a better fit for skeptics:SE.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>You ask how can it be considered ""conspiracy""?</strong></p>

<p>Your thesis seems to be that the United States conspired with the Israeli government to cover up a deliberate attack on a US Navy vessel by the IDF. Further, your quotes are all sourced from a site that also argues the existence of a conspiracy and cover-up. If that is your thesis, then the question probably does belong on the Skeptics site.</p>

<p>In this instance, it's not a question of whether you locate the original quotes, it's a question of whether those quotes have been chosen selectively for that site, and whether they were taken within context.</p>

<p>It is also not a question of the positions that these people had formerly occupied. The question should be 'Do these people have any direct knowledge of the events in question"". The statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I feel the Israelis knew what they were doing. They knew they were shooting at a U.S. Navy ship""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>means nothing. It isn't evidence one way or the other. What someone <em>feels</em> might have happened isn't evidence. Their former position is irrelevant unless it gave them access to specific information about the incident. Including comments like this in your question does make it look more like an argument for a conspiracy theory, and less like a history question.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>The quotes</strong></p>

<p>In fact, only three of your sources cited any information to support the claim that the attack was deliberate. Former US Ambassador to Lebanon Dwight Porter</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""It's an American ship!"" the pilot of an Israeli Mirage fighter-bomber radioed Tel Aviv as he sighted the USS Liberty on June 8, 1967. Israeli headquarters ordered the pilot to attack the American ship.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant General William E. Odom, former director, National Security Agency:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""On the strength of intercept transcripts of pilots' conversations during the attack, the question of the attack's deliberateness ""just wasn't a disputed issue"" within the agency.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and Oliver Kirby, former deputy director for operations/production, National Security Agency:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I can tell you for an absolute certainty (from intercepted communications) that they knew they were attacking an American ship.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You'll notice that all three cite the same source - intercepted radio communication from the IDF pilots.</p>

<p>However, when researching for my answer, it did not take me long to find a report in the Wall Street Journal of a 2001 letter from former Navy Chief Petty Officer Marvin Nowicki. He had been the chief Hebrew-language analyst aboard a U.S. Navy EC-121 spy plane that was intercepting Israeli aircraft communications during the attack on the USS Liberty.</p>

<p>He stated that he did indeed hear (and record) Israeli pilots’ and captains’ references to the U.S. flag flying on the deck of the Liberty, but that <strong><em>these remarks were made only after the attack was underway, and not before</em></strong>. Shockingly, that particular story does not appear to be quoted on the site you referenced.</p>

<p>You might very well think that is because it undermines their claim of a conspiracy. I, however, couldn't possibly comment.</p>

<p>Now, I can't speak for anyone else, but as an historical researcher I would always give far more weight to the testimony of an eyewitness than to that of someone who later saw a report about an incident - regardless of their respective ranks. The only reason an historian would ignore that evidence would be because it didn't support the conclusion they were trying to reach. And that is bad practice (not just in the study of history)!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>The edit timeline</strong></p>

<p>Like I said right at the start, I'm not one of the people who voted to close the question. However, looking at the timeline of edits I can see that the question was only closed after you'd gone through a series of edits to incorporate quotes taken from a site which, as I explained above, is attempting to prove a conspiracy. </p>

<p>Personally, I would not be surprised if that was a factor in at least some cases for deciding that the question was off-topic for this site. It may also be a factor in the impressive number of downvotes that the question has attracted.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>So, could the original question have been written in a way that was on-topic for this site?</strong></p>

<p>I think so. I'd suggest that the structure of a valid question could be:</p>

<ol>
<li>A (very brief) description of the incident, with a link to a site
for people who want to find out more. Try to find an unbiased site,
or perhaps just Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Mention the declassified report from the <a href=""https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/uss-liberty/assets/files/dia-messages/israeli-court-inquiry.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Israeli Court of
Enquiry</a>. Now, if you are going to quote from the report, quote
the text exactly as written. Do not attempt to improve their
spelling or grammar, and do not paraphrase, as you have done in the
question here. Also, <strong>be very careful to avoid the appearance of
quoting selectively from the text</strong>. In the excerpt you've included
here, for example, you chose to omit the evidence that 2 IDF
officers on 2 different vessels apparently independently identified
the ship as Egyptian. Whether or not that evidence was true,
omitting it from your question, while including the later section
from the bottom of page 5, creates the impression of bias. Generally, I 
would suggest that it is better in cases like this just to quote the 
conclusions, and let people read the whole document for themselves.</li>
<li>State that many survivors have never accepted the findings of the
Israeli Court of Enquiry. State that their opinion seems to be
shared by a number of former high ranking US officials. Provide a
link to your site (as you did in the original version of the
question) to support these assertions. Feel free to mention a few names, but 
there is no need to quote every one of them (or, indeed any of them) in your 
question. People can click the link and read for themselves.</li>
<li>Point out that the NSA has <a href=""https://www.nsa.gov/search/?q=uss%20liberty&amp;sort=date&amp;media=document&amp;section=declass&amp;page=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">released hundreds of declassified documents</a> 
since 1967, some of which directly relate to the incident.</li>
<li>Finally, ask whether there is any <strong>evidence</strong> amongst all the
material declassified since 1967 to contradict the official version
of events - i.e. that the attack was a mistake, resulting from poor
communication between units of the IDF and the mis-identification of
the vessel.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>But that is just my opinion</strong>. Others may take a different view.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Editing questions with existing answers</strong></p>

<p>I would also suggest that it is also worth bearing in mind that in response to <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3598/24858"">another question</a> here on meta, people expressed strong views about questions being edited in a way that then invalidates existing answers (I can't say for certain, but that may explain some of the downvotes you've received in this case).</p>

<p>Given that, I would suggest that in those circumstances it is worth asking a new question.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Your Questions</h2>

<p>You have asked 2 questions (apart from your ""Solicitations for Ideas""). I shall try to answer the second question first.</p>

<p>You new question, or ""second wording"" as you refer to it, is actually a very different question.</p>

<p>The new question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""... what historical events had the most influence on relatively cool relations prior to 1967, and exponentially improving relations after 1967?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>bears almost no relation to the original question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Why did the Israeli Defense Force attack the USS Liberty on June 8, 1967 killing 32 American Sailors, wounding 171, and doing so much damage to the ship that it ultimately had to be scrapped.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, given the views expressed in the answers to the question I mentioned above, about questions being edited in a way that then invalidates existing answers, I suspect that we have the answer to your second question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Why can't we open the existing question given as written the original question asked for reasons for the attack, and was not about the attack itself. Both question dealt with events leading up to the attack?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Because it is not the same question</strong>. </p>

<p>You should have asked a new question, rather than editing the original. Never mind the merits, or otherwise, of the new question, if people think that you should not have edited the question in the first place they probably won't vote to re-open.</p>

<p>Of course, I may be wrong. The answer may just be 42. (It's a messed-up Universe!)</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, as to your first question, you asked whether the new question is more acceptable.</p>

<p>Personally, I see several problems with the new question as it stands. The most obvious of which are implicit assumption that US foreign aid to Israel was only contingent on events in the region and that you are quoting average figures over long periods of time which do not appear to reflect the detail in the table on the site from which you are quoting.</p>

<p>In the new question, you also appear to be claiming that the attack on the USS Liberty had a particular significance for US/Israeli relations without providing any clear evidence to support that assertion. Put simply, <em>why would the USS Liberty attack on 8 June 8 1967 act as a fulcrum or pivot</em>?</p>

<p>In the absence of <em>specific</em> supporting evidence, this would risk being classified as just another instance of the (all too common) logical fallacy, <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">post hoc ergo propter hoc</a></em>. Just because something occurs <em>after</em> an event does not imply that it happened <em>because</em> of that event.</p>

<p>For me, you would need to add that supporting evidence to the question, or we are likely to be back to the conspiracy theory arguments.</p>

<p>For example, 1967 was also in the middle of a pivotal period in the Vietnam War and the build up of US forces there under President Johnson. Not to mention the small matter of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tet_Offensive"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tet Offensive</a> in Vietnam in early 1968. Now, I don't lay claim to any particular inside knowledge, but it seems to me - in the absence of any new evidence - just as likely that the global situation, particularly in regard to the escalation in Vietnam, might have been the trigger for increased funding for America's main ally in the Middle East through the 1970s, and that the attack on the USS Liberty wasn't a factor at all.</p>

<p>So why do you think that the attack on the USS Liberty changed US foreign policy in 1967/68? What evidence are you offering in support of that position? Are there declassified papers that suggest that this was the case? Non-trivial assertions that are not supported by evidence are <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/618/24858"">rarely well received</a> on this site.</p>

<hr>

<p>From what you have written, it seems that you have a particular answer that you believe to be correct. If that is indeed the case, you can <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/self-answer"">post a new question and answer it yourself</a>, but remember that the normal rules and guidance about asking and answering questions will still apply. It still needs to be on-topic for this site.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Role of Moderators</h2>

<p>Lastly, you have asked about moderator concerns.</p>

<p>At this point I'll put my moderator hat back on, but please bear in mind that I'm still just speaking for myself. Other moderators may interpret the guidance differently.</p>

<hr>

<p>I think you misunderstand the role of moderators on Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>Personally, I am trying to exercise a ""light-touch"", in accordance with my reading of the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/05/18/a-theory-of-moderation/"">Theory of Moderation</a>, which explains that we are ""human exception-handlers"". Interpret that as you will!</p>

<p>As a moderator I can close or re-open questions with a single vote. However, just because I can doesn't mean that I should.</p>

<p>I've argued here on meta in the past that some questions have been closed when they shouldn't have been. I now have the power to re-open them. I haven't done so because I think that would be an abuse of that power. (In fact, now I can't even nominate them to be re-opened and let the community decide. As a moderator, if I vote to re-open, the question is just re-opened"").</p>

<p>Except in particularly egregious cases (Nazi spammers, posts that are just 'vandalism', etc.), I prefer to let the community vote. If I do vote to close or re-open, the it will normally only be as the fifth (or, at a push, the fourth) vote.</p>

<p>If posts are flagged for moderator attention by members of the community then I, or one of my fellow moderators, will review the flag and decide accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>What that means in the context of your question is that I will not normally override a decision to close a post by members of the community</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to get a post that was closed by the community re-opened, you will need to convince the community that it <em>should</em> be re-opened. (If the post was closed by a moderator then there is a <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/reopen-questions"">procedure</a> available to you if you want us to reconsider the decision).</p>

<p>Just so we are clear between us, nothing like that was in my question.
My thesis if I were to construct one now would have to reference one of my two questions?  Or at least something I actually did write.</p>
<p>A conspiracy by the United States government would imply malicious or harmful intent of a cover up.  I never even alluded to such a thing. US actions can be explained without any malicious intent, just by reviewing historical events.

<p>That quote is from <a href=""http://ifamericaknew.org/us_ints/ul-boston.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Captain Ward Boston</a>, Judge Advocate General Council for the US Navy.  He was Senior legal counsel for the Navy’s Court of Inquiry into the attack.  Clearly he was in a position to hear the complete proceedings as well be aware of all of the evidence still classified about the incident.  His opinion should have meaning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>sempaiscuba:</strong>
In fact, only three of your sources cited any information to support the claim that the attack was deliberate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I never said the attack was deliberate.  All I was out to prove with my quotes was that their is doubt on the American side of the Israeli explanation.  Which is all I had to prove to have my question regarded as a history question rather than a conspiracy question.  That was my intent on introducing the quotes which otherwise don't relate to my question.  As I said in my above quote all the quotes express doubt about the Israeli position.  I'll give you Johnson and the Israelis I added in later because someone asked me too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@sempaiscuba</strong><br />
So, could the original question have been written in a way that was on-topic for this site?</p>
<p>I think so. I'd suggest that the structure of a valid question could be:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All good advice, including the part about editing questions with existing answers, which I was not aware of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@sempaiscuba</strong><br />
Your new question, or &quot;second wording&quot; as you refer to it, is actually a very different question.  bears almost no relation to the original question:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My first question, &quot;why the attack&quot;.  My second question &quot;historical events had the most influence on relatively cool relations&quot; to me is the same questions.  I can see how you would not think of them that way.   I was always trying to get at plausible reasons for the attack.  But I see your point.  To you they are entirely different questions because you would answer them differently than I.</p>
<p>To my mind both questions are answered with reference to the same events.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire Bombing the US Consulate.</li>
<li>Attempted fire bombing the US Embassy</li>
<li>Leading an UN Arms embargo against Israel.</li>
<li>Threatening Israel's private donations from the US.</li>
<li>Forcing Israel out of the Sinai in 57, the buffer between their largest existential threat, and the objective of the six day war.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@sempaiscuba</strong><br />
Now, as to your first question,
In the new question, you also appear to be claiming that the attack on the USS Liberty had a particular significance for US/Israeli relations without providing any clear evidence to support that assertion. Put simply, why would the USS Liberty attack on 8 June 8 1967 act as a fulcrum or pivot?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In truth,  given annual US aid to Israel jumped two orders of magnitude in the decade following the attack, or 5 times in the following year(68), I am not claiming it.  I am observing it.  The attack was a pivotal moment in the two countries relation.  Perhaps I should have used pivotal instead of fulcrum.  If I went into the details of explaining why, wouldn't I be answering my own question?  Maybe I should have done that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@sempaiscuba</strong>
The most obvious of which are implicit assumption that US foreign aid to Israel was only contingent on events in the region and that you are quoting average figures over long periods of time which do not appear to reflect the detail in the table on the site from which you are quoting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually I think I was asserting the opposite.   That US aid to Israel increased by a factor of 5 from 67 when the attack took place to 1968, demonstrates the United States aid was not contingent on Israel's attack.  Your thought on the cold war is what I would go with also.</p>
<p>@SEMPAISCUBA,  Thank you again for a very informative discussion on board workings.  My take away is perhaps this could be a forum to discuss such topics, but not by me.  A relatively new member still trying to prove his chops.  Perhaps you or one of the other elite vanguard would be more successful.  Anyway I will keep swinging and try to show my worth.   Thank You for hearing me out.</p>

<p>Personally, it's highly unlikely that I'll upvote an answer without sources, especially if the question is on something about which I know little. Why? Because without sources it becomes more difficult for me to inform myself and to assess the quality of the answer. If it's on something I know a fair amount about, I'll often be able to recognize where the information (probably) came from (but it should still be sourced for those who have no more than a superficial knowledge).</p>

That is quite fascinating and also sometimes quite frustrating, especially on beta sites where sometimes the documentation is not very evolved.

Way too often one reads that ""SE is degenerating"" or ""a toxic environment"".</p></li>

<h3>How to get better quality questions and stay friendly and welcoming?</h3>

<p>The first message a new user sees should be from a review that comments a real ""Welcome message"", reminding them to read <em>some</em> documentation, like tour and ask. (This is designed to be <em>not</em> mandatory. A system design flaw in my opinion.) Additionally concrete problems of the question might then be added to this comment. Criticising new users is necessary, but with a certain relaxed attitude and a little bit of patience. </p>

<p>Immediate downvotes and close votes are a very harsh experience and in my opinion neither really appropriate for improvable or even salvageable questiona really needed on that scale witnessed almost daily. (Of course, this does not apply to <em>really</em> bad questions, spam or rude posts etc.) This immediate action approach is amplified in its bad effects if the comments are unthoughtful, borderline insulting or somehow arrogant.</p>

<p>The first comment should be strict, but friendly, welcoming and helpful, if there are any problems, then these should be addressed in that comment, if possible. If there are no problems with the question, and this is in my experience very rare, network wide, that a newbie signs up and starts posting perfect questions, the welcoming comment might be optional. </p>

<p><strong>ANSWER RATIO</strong></p>

<p>If yannis is right (and he's been around for a while), we probably shouldn't worry too much about the 'answer ratio'. I would hope, also, that the SE powers that be would note that many questions here have one or two really good answers, and that any additional answers are unlikely to be more than repetition, spam or relevant 'scraps' which are better filed under 'comments' than 'answers'. I'm struggling to see how, for example, the following would benefit from more answers:</p>

</ol>

<p><strong>QUESTIONS PER DAY</strong></p>

<p>'Questions per day' is probably another matter as we are someway from the target. Among the possible solutions to this might be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be more supportive of new users' questions. Much has been said on this <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3669/dealing-with-newbie-questions-again"">recently</a> and although I think we definitely need to do this, we don't want the site flooded with sub-standard, poorly researched questions either.</li>
<li>Ask more questions ourselves. Although we do need new members to keep the site alive and 'fresh', old members should be much better equipped to ask 'quality' questions. That said, the best questions tend to stem from a genuine desire to know something rather than trying to 'force it'...</li>
<li>Upvote questions more. No, I'm not recommending bribery (see below 'On the last point...). Nor am I suggesting an indiscriminate upvote on anything that doesn't deserve to be closed, but there is a clear imbalance between the number of upvotes on questions and upvotes on answers (not to mention that answers get 10 and questions only 5). </li>
</ol>

<p>On this last point, reputation is particularly important for newbies: it's needed to the get privileges which allow them to participate more actively on the site in the long-term (which will make it more likely that they'll stay). However, asking questions doesn't seem to be nearly as good a way to get reputation as riding on the coat tails of popular questions by giving short answers which (due to the sheer number of views) have a good chance of picking up 2 or 3 votes (4 to 6 upvotes on a question) even though they don't really add anything that hasn't already been said.</p>

<p>The A - 10 / Q - 5 vote policy applies to all sites, and I've no reason to doubt that for most SE sites its a good policy. On History, though, I beg to differ: <strong>a good question can easily take longer to research and formulate than a good answer</strong>, especially if you are not already well-informed on the general area of the question. We can't change SE policy, but we can change the way we vote on questions.</p>

<p>There does seem to have been an increase in this and, if Robert Cartaino feels the need to update an old post on this, perhaps we need to pay serious attention - or am I misunderstanding something here?</p>

<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>

<p>This 'question' is already far longer than originally intended so, to get to the point:</p>

<ol>
<li>How are we going to increase the number of questions without compromising quality?</li>
<li>Should we be worried about the amount of block copying, even from non-Wikipedia sources?</li>
<li>How will (1) and (2) impact our chances of graduating?</li>

<p>1) (When) Is History ever going to get out of ""Beta""?</p>

<p>2) Is History in danger of being closed down if it remains in Beta?</p>

<p><strong>When is History going to get out of ""Beta""?</strong></p>

<p>The criteria for ""graduation"" out of beta has changed in recent years. Its a bit fuzzy, but it now basically boils down to consistently <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257614/graduation-site-closure-and-a-clearer-outlook-on-the-health-of-se-sites"">generating 10 questions a day</a>.</p>

<p>As a mod I get access to some great statistical information, including nice pretty graphs of our performance over any time period I care to ask for, which I frustratingly am not allowed to share. However, what I believe I <em>can</em> say is we have always been on a steady (if bumpy) upslope on QPD which, if projected into the future, puts our average over 10 (eyeballing it here) in roughly 3 or 4 years. That's of course assuming growth remains like it has been in the past.</p>

<p>As a user you can perform a quick check of this yourself, by going to the main page and clicking on ""Questions"" and then ""Newest"". Just count up how many you see for each day. As of this writing, the last three days are 8, 9, and 9, but that's likely just a blip. The last few times I've done this check the 3 day average has been a smidge over 7.</p>

<p>I know ""3 years"" sounds like a lot, but I've been tracking this since nearly inception, and for me we are getting tantalizingly close. When I started as a moderator we were getting roughly 4.5 QPD. I'm quite confident we'll get there.</p>

<p><strong>Is History in danger of being closed down if it remains in Beta?</strong></p>

<p>No. </p>

<p>The latest info from Stack Exchange is that sites can remain in Beta <strong>indefinitely</strong>, as long as they are useful functioning sites. Sites that get closed are ones that are incapable of keeping themselves clean of garbage posts, or where no questions are getting answered. We are worlds past that kind of poor state. So as long as we don't drastically regress, and SE can afford to keep the servers powered, we have a home here.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>CODA: Well, let's all just post tons of questions then!</strong></p>

<p>If you think you can do that, and make them good answerable questions, and <strong>keep it up indefinitely</strong>, go for it. But I honestly don't think the best way to get there is by trying to artificially pump up one stat. I'd rather see us get more users and more visitors, such that we get more than 10 questions a day with no special effort at all.</p>

<p>To that end, if you can promote this site, and treat new users reasonably when they venture to participate, that is probably better. People need to keep this site good with useful answers, good edits and tags, and free from douchbaggery too.</p>

<p>Do what <em>you can do best</em> to make this a good useful site for everyone, and we'll get there together.</p>

<p>The referenced post answers <em>both</em> aspects from the question, <em>and</em> an improvement suggestion from one of the comments below the question. The other two answers leave out the ""deeper"" part; entirely. It is well researched and amply referenced. The other two are both ephemeral, largely theoretical, and include one link each with dubious relevance to the question or the answers. </p>

<p>Delivering a comprehensive answer on both parts of the question seems unwanted by some. One commentator criticised the question as better to rephrase it into the direction of not D-Day but ""right to the end of the war"". The referenced answer even covered that, despite the OP not editing his question to react to this suggestion.</p>

<p>Then the referenced answer was criticised as following an agenda: ""It's a simple yes/no question. But no occasion can be missed to push one's own agenda about Germans"" – Is there an anti-German bias? From what the author wrote or from what he quotes?</p>

<p>Then it was deemed at ""denouncing"" policies of two states. What is ""denouncing"" in describing these policies; with agreeing references from reputable sources?</p>

<p>An explicit offer to edit the question was taken up on and primarily concerned with removing referenced evidence for – yes, some calls them as such – scandals  quite central to the ""deeper"" part of answering the question.</p>

<p>Admittedly, it might have been less than ideal how the author handled the translation of bureaucratic German into readable English at first. That was attempted to be addressed with increased precision, yet the quibbles that followed about <em>Ersatzzeit</em> were no longer about accuracy for the occasion but making a stance that might be appropriate for a meta-discussion about a dictionary – but <em>certainly</em> not applicable to the quote in question and especially not if related back to the actual question. </p>

<p>Finally the characterisation of the goals and circumstances when introducing the long standing German pension system was criticised: ""dismisses the whole pension system"". It might indeed be read as dismissing, but it was just a paraphrasing summary from <em>the words of the inventor of that system</em> and reinforced by citing researchers on that topic who – in the author's understanding at least – support the cynical interpretation of the whole construction. Loving the current pension system and its history so much that the thoughts of the first chancellor, and many that followed him, or researchers on that topic are perceived as so hurtful to justify dismissing this answer seems quite understandable in its illogical furor.</p>

<p>To top it off, the author was personally criticised for taking a ""defensive posture in comments"" while trying to address justified criticism (which the first comment was certainly not), to explain inapplicable or unjustified criticism, and even explicitly inviting more ""criticise to improve comments"". </p>

<p>The author fails to see any valid criticism left, towards the current shape of the answer, to <em>not</em> answering the question, to use either offensive or opinionated language on his own. The author also fails to see that the sources might be questionable, the explanations, or the conclusions.</p>

<p>These observations leave largely two possible conclusions. Either there is still something validly described as content-wise 'wrong' with the answer. That would be quite nice to know. Or, the voting on this answer shows a certain irrational behaviour, perhaps even an agenda on its own. If it is the latter, it would be beneficial to hear some opinions on how this pure popularity voting effect might be addressed.</p>

<p>Other than resorting to popular banalities that are prime time TV compatible, currently it seems that ""don't mention the war"" is the best way around these controversial issues around and about ""Germany"". Given the site's aim, scope and title, that is not ideal.</p>

<li>Spending too much time and space on not answering the main question is likely to either make readers move on to something else (especially if the answer is lengthy) or to downvote, perhaps because they feel their time has been wasted.</li>
<li>Lengthy answers and excerpts are also likely to make people move on to something else, usually without voting one way or the other.</li>
<li>I don't think edits usually repair all the 'damage' done by what is seen as a 'bad' answer for the simple reason that a lot of people don't re-visit answers they've already voted on. Look at your rep stats, 3 of the downvotes came in early, before any upvotes and before much of the editing.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the record, I didn't vote up or down on your answer (because of 1, 2 and 3 above). For some, even though your answer was indeed more comprehensive, it seems an answer which has more merits than demerits gets downvoted - unfair in my view, but no one here has the right to tell anyone else how to vote so I can only speak for myself.</p>

<p>We all get it a bit wrong sometimes, and I've certainly been guilty of overlong answers at times.

  <p>The GDR did not join the NATO, ever. What happend there (in 1990) was that the GDR ceased to exist, and the FRG expanded to include the five federal states constituting the territory of the former GDR. That was an eastward expansion of NATO borders, but not the accepting of a former Warsaw Pact nation into NATO.

  <h2>When should comments be deleted?</h2>
  
  <p><a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/privileges/comment"">Comments are temporary ""Post-It"" notes left on a question or
  answer</a>. You should
  not expect them to be around forever: Once a clarification has been
  made, an edit added to the post to include new information, or the
  issue in the comment is otherwise resolved, it is subject to deletion.
  In reality, many obsolete or chatty comments remain untouched due to
  the high volume of comments posted, but this does not mean that they
  can't or shouldn't be deleted in the future.</p>

<p>The trivia close reason is used, in practice, for closing questions that are apparently answered by Wikipedia. However, the word ""trivia"" is rather nebulous. Many perfectly fine questions regarding factoids could be considered ""trivia"", for instance. On the other hand, questions on complex subjects may still be closed if Wikipedia happens to have an exact article.</p>

<p>So, I suggest we modify it by adapting the old ""general reference"" close reason. Moreover, since many of our best questions arise from users challenging Wikipedia's claims, I also suggest including a clarification on how such questions should proceed.</p>

<p>Basically, something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question is <strong>too basic</strong>; it can be definitively answered by a single link to the relevant topic on Wikipedia or another standard reference source. If you are instead questioning the correctness of a reference source, please edit the post to supply a link and explain what you find unclear, or why you believe it to be wrong or incomplete.</p>

Generally speaking, if an answer can <em>easily</em> be found on Wikipedia we should indicate that in a comment rather than 'duplicating' the information an answer. Copy - pasting large chunks of Wikipedia is unacceptable and undermines the usefulness and credibility of History SE.</p>

<p>However, sometimes the answer to a question cannot <em>easily</em> be found. A good example is this answer to a question on the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/43949/what-would-the-vietcong-do-to-the-southern-vietnamese-that-didnt-want-to-join-t"">Vietnam War</a> (problem is search terms).

<p>When using Wikipedia, the notes / sources of the article should <em>always</em> be checked. If there are no citations, don't use it (or at least point out that the information you are quoting is uncited). Also, some of the sources used may be dated or disputed, or may have been misused or misinterpreted.</p>

</ul>

<p>(These particular examples are all behind paywalls, but I'm sure that a Google search will turn up other, similar, articles which will doubtless make the same points)</p>

<p>Personally, I am generally quite relaxed about using it to provide links to the pages for people mentioned in my answers, since this is mainly to provide background detail for people unfamiliar with the subject or person.</p>

<p>For example, in my answer to the question <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/39934/24858"">Why did the Germans spare Allied troops trapped at Dunkirk?</a>, I've tried to link to all the Wikipedia pages for the individuals mentioned in my answer. These are not essential details, but simply background information to help those unfamiliar with the <em>dramatis personae</em>.</p>

<p>I'm also generally happy to provide links to Wikipedia for uncontentious topics, although with a note of caution that you didn't mention. While the URL to the Wikipedia page shouldn't change, the content of that page might. Almost anyone can edit Wikipedia - it is, in its <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">own words</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers who write without pay. Anyone with Internet access can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You might link to a page with content that is uncontentious, and which provides the mainstream view about a topic, a future edit may change that.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, for things like the British Expeditionary Force, and the background to the Dunkirk evacuation itself which I also mentioned in my answer above the Wikipedia pages again provide useful background for those less-familiar with the subject.</p>

<p>However, for the documents that provide the main sources for my answer (the diaries of General Halder, the note from Major-General Alfred Jodl to labour minister Robert Ley, etc.) I prefer to link to online, digitised versions of the original documents where possible.</p>

<p>Now, Wikipedia is getting better at providing sources for its content, but it is a slow process (see the reviews in the academic journals listed above). <strong><em>Wikipedia is still no substitute for proper peer-reviewed sources.</em></strong> </p>

<p>Unfortunately, many of the journals containing those sources are now only available online behind a paywall. I was challenged about this when I provided links to this type of site in some of my early answers (I pay for access to the relevant sites because I need them for research).</p>

<p>That actually seems to me to be a reasonable complaint. The point of linking to the source is to support the assertions we make in our questions and answers. If others can't read those sources, then how do they know we are quoting them correctly? How can they follow up on the answer and take their research further? </p>

<p>It is also clearly going to be extremely frustrating to have to search for alternatives (as you may have now experienced yourself in the case of the journal articles I cited above)!</p>

<p>On other questions, I have used books from my own 'library' as the source for my answer. I'm lucky in that regard. I own quite a lot of books. Unfortunately, while books are wonderful things, they can be difficult to share online. Often, those books are also available on Google Books, but Sods-Law dictates that the preview doesn't include the relevant pages.</p>

<p>I have often spent longer looking for decent online sources to support the points in my answer than I spent on writing the answer itself. [If anyone is interested, I've found archive.org to be a very useful resource in that regard. In particular, they have a complete series of the Congressional Record which is obviously <em>the</em> go-to source for a lot of American political history].</p>

<hr>

<p>However, yes, in the final analysis, and given all the caveats mentioned above, sometimes it is just easier to quote Wikipedia.</p>

<p>If the article there is well written (many articles are, despite the criticisms people often make), and if the [current] content appears to be correct, then I'm reasonable happy to include it as a link in my answer. I would argue that is generally better than providing no supporting source at all.</p>

<p>At least then others can review my source, and challenge it if they feel that it it wrong (hopefully they would also provide alternative sources to support their position). And surely that is, in fact, the main reason for providing supporting sources in the first place.</p>

Dominance of extractive industry (no - a thousand times over - my favorite example is guano)?  Commodity based economies (no - dutch disease).    If you don't specify what it is you think is unique, then I will downvote you hard and smile while doing so.  Because every possible answer is equally valid.  Has there ever been anything like X? Yes, my aunt edna is exactly like X!  You can't prove I'm wrong; you can't even assert that I'm wrong, because if you don't provide definition of the phenomena or a way to measure it, then I can pick any measure, including gematria or horoscopes.</p>

<p>Not everything that might benefit from backup from other sources needs to be an academic history research paper. </p>

<p>Illustrating a peripheral point in an answer can give you a hard time finding academic or otherwise reliable online sources. Contrasting supposedly common knowledge or basic facts with historical  research can give you a hard time backing it up with online articles or comparable sources alone. Sometimes such a scholarly source exists, but it is either behind paywalls or it is simply not online at all.</p>

<p>The point is, anyone striving to provide an answer is regarded as someone having a say because she knows something. Something more than the asker, something more or in addition or improving on, correcting previous answers. Furthering the discussion.</p>

<h2>Fixes</h2>

<p>Mere statements are not very helpful in these cases. Arguments need some kind of backup most of the time. Pointing out a logical flaw in a line of reasoning might be sufficiently called out by explaining why you think it is flawed. But when discussing the pros and cons  of conflicting sources or narratives you most often need to quote that, refer to that, give links to that. We need the transparency most. Everyone should form his own opinion and be able to check the sources that form the basis of your post.</p>

<p>As an answer poster you are also a judge, a gate-keeper an evaluator of the material available to you, of your own knowledge. As such it is up to you to find the best evidence, the strongest argument the best data to backup your claims, your arguments or reasoning. Low quality sources are permitted! Low quality sources are also miserable and shine a bad light on your answer and on you.</p>

<p>That is why we need reliable sources. If you want to backup your claim about perhaps well-known facts that are non-central to your argument, then higher standard historical sources might not be the easiest to accomplish what you want to say.</p>

<p>Peripheral sources I would like to call them should be fine to illustrate, to give context to weigh the arguments. Central claims need reliable sources central to the field of discussion. One might contrast yellow press articles with what books or research articles have to say about a certain topic. It will be almost fruitless to just refer to personal anecdotes or a TV host's statements to backup <em>your</em> statement.</p>

<p>You do not know or have the truth. Your sources do not have or know the truth. –– Everyone is entitled to his own stupidity. Or geniality. There is always room for improvement.</p>

<p>I believe it can be answered with historical sources and methods if the practice has been prevalent there and for how long. If there is insufficient data to determine this, then this fact will constitute a valid answer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But I ask you to be very careful to structure the question so that it is precise, answerable through historical sources and methods, and that the probability of learning is greater than the probability of offense.</p>

<p>I believe my question is objective and precise. I also believe that StackExchange's standards are high enough that this question will not become a haven for trolls and haters.</p>

<p>I do not understand how am I running afoul this site's rules.</p>

<p>Many people in the comments mentioned that I was insulting and offensive. I do not believe that an objective, fact-based discussion about stereotypes alleging particular embarrassing practices to a certain group is automatically insulting or offensive. I do not believe that the existence of such stereotypes necessities precluding an objective, fact-based discussion about their alleged grounds in reality. Instead, I believe that <strong>the alleged truthfulness of such stereotypes ought to be objectively discussed</strong> – If it can be found and proven that these stereotypes are groundless, <strong>then such a discussion can only be beneficial to the offended group</strong>; should however these stereotypes be found truthful, then unfortunately the notably high prevalence of bestiality among a particular group is an encyclopedic and notable fact that should be noted objectively, neutrally and in a non-hateful way – since representing reality is <strong>not</strong> offensive by itself, <strong>however sad and undesirable this reality might be. Rather, representing reality is both a purpose and a duty of science</strong>.</p>

<p>If however I, unintentionally, worded the question in a less-than-perfect way that can be perceived as insulting, I am open to any suggestions how to word it in a more objective and neutral way. I <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/posts/46014/revisions"">tried</a> to reword it according to <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/46014/has-bestiality-been-noticeably-prevalent-among-muslim-middle-east-people-and-f#comment124853_46014"">Semaphore's suggestions</a>; a problem that remains is that the word ""prevalence"" has been perceived as insulting – I don't understand this, I thought this was a precise and neutral term frequently used in research, if I was wrong then I'm sorry and again, I'm open to any suggestions how to improve this.</p>

<p>But if my question is fundamentally off-topic and cannot be fixed by rewording it – then please explain why, because I really don't get why.</p>

<p>I wish that I had found an easier way to quote/reference only the last sentence of my answer - what I wanted to emphasize was the importance of phrasing things so that the value of learning overwhelmed the probability of offense. Everything else was contextual so that that statement didn't float in a void.  </p>

<p>I'm not sure how to clearly articulate the following, other than to say that I think the question falls into a region where there are multiple legitimate opinions.  I want to be clear that I think the opinions you express in the question are valid - I'm not arguing that you're wrong.  (In my opinion, half the flamewars on the internet are driven by a failure to distinguish between ""I""m right you're wrong"" and ""I don't see it that way...."" - this falls solidly in the latter group).  I guess what I'm trying to make very explicit here is that I'm trying to discuss the question, not to discuss you.  I hope that makes sense.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In my opinion, the original title was objectively hurtful - reading that title without the question would legitimately propagate the ethnic slur in question. I proposed an edit, and you thanked me for it - I think this moved the question closer to the center.  (I mention this because I think it supports that we both approached this as mature, reasonable people).</p></li>
<li><p>I see your point about objective discussion, but I can't agree with it.  In my opinion, ethnic slurs don't occur in an objective realm; they are primarily and fundamentally an emotional issue.  I suspect, although I can't prove, that they are chosen to be more effective at manipulating emotions than in persuading the mind.  Discussion of ethnic slurs can reasonably be expected to be harmful unless they meet an extraordinarily high standard.  The history of the stereotype renders it into a symbol in and of itself. That's why we recognize certain words as hate speech; their emotional value dominates their objective value.  I think it is prudent to err on the side of caution This is not clearly stated in the ""<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice"">be nice</a>"" policy, but I believe it is implied.  (I really don't like using implied policy, but in this case I choose to let the implied policy guide my behavior.)  There is an element of ""When did you stop beating your wife?"". The Ethnicity is forced into the position of defending against an accusation that has no validity.</p></li>
<li><p>The question perpetrates the stereotype without any serious evidence of the actual behavior, nor does it answer whether the behavior is more prevalent among the ethnic group in question than in other ethnic groups or the general populace.  (not your intent, but these are some of the high standards that I would apply to this type of questions.)</p></li>
<li><p>the behavior in question is not value neutral.  If we were discussing whether they ate the large end of the egg or the small end of the egg first, I would be inclined to agree that objective discussion would be useful.  The behavior in question is one that most cultures condemn; consequently discussing it associates that behavior with that ethnic group.  I believe when the association between the ethnic group and the behavior is proven to be false, the association remains (I'm actually pretty sure of this, but I don't have the evidence/citations to hand, so I'm just going to assert it as an opinion).  I wish that you were right and that objective discussion would change opinions.  On issues of prejudice I don't see any evidence that objective discussion of stereotyped behavior changes opinions/values/attitudes.</p></li>
<li><p>I think it is important to apply an empathy standard as well as an objectivity standard.   You've phrased your question as responsibly as you can, but I have to ask myself whether</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If my Muslim friends read this, would they be hurt? Would they think less of me for participating in a discussion of this topic?</p></li>
<li><p>if this were about my personal ethnic group, would I be hurt? Would I recognize the objectivity, or would history dominate objectivity?  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>At least for me, I cannot answer those two questions in a way that makes me comfortable. </p></li>

<p>Unless the person making the comment indicates that he/she intends to develop an answer from this comment within a few days, might it not be acceptable for someone else to post a <strong>community wiki answer</strong> using any pertinent information left in these comments? Of course, this would mean sourcing them and expanding on them a little rather than just copy-pasting the comment(s).</p>

<p>This might lead to some answers being only partial but - as long as it has some substance - this seems better than no answer at all. Also, others might be inspired to edit in more info.</p>

<hr />
<p>More in depth explanation:</p>
<p>People have a tendency to treat comments like they matter, or are permanent, or as places to put information that they for whatever reason don't want to put in an actual answer. Guess what? They're not.</p>
<p>Comments are, first and foremost, ephemeral. They're inherently impermanent. If you post a comment, don't expect it to stick around for long.</p>
<p>You're told this when you first gain the privilege to leave comments, at 50 reputation. You get a nice notification &quot;congrats, you've earned this privilege. Learn about it in the help center.&quot;<br />
Alright, so let's go look at the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/comment"">help center</a>.</p>
<p>And the very first line (well, second, but the first is just a &quot;what are comments?&quot; so that doesn't count) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comments are temporary &quot;Post-It&quot; notes left on a question or answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right there. <em>Temporary Post-It notes</em>. Not permanent notes on an answer. Just an ephemeral note... that has a very specific purpose.</p>
<p>This is where the Post-It note analogy ends. While Post-It notes can be used for a whole multitude of things, comments are really intended for three very specific purposes, again enumerated in the help center.</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>When should I comment?</h1>
<p>You should submit a comment if you want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request <strong>clarification</strong> from the author;</li>
<li>Leave <strong>constructive criticism</strong> that guides the author in improving the post;</li>
<li>Add relevant but <strong>minor or transient information</strong> to a post (e.g. a link to a related question, or an alert to the author that the question has been updated).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Three very specific purposes... which happen to not include answering the question. In fact, in the next section, &quot;When shouldn't I comment?&quot;, we see mention of answering the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>When <em>shouldn't</em> I comment?</h1>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><strong>Answering a question</strong> or providing an alternate solution to an existing answer; instead, post an actual answer (or edit to expand an existing one);</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we wanted people to write answers in comments like that, answers wouldn't exist. Not to mention that writing answers in comments has some serious drawbacks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comments cannot be downvoted, only upvoted, and so you can't have the quality checks that answers have. You cannot edit comments to improve them after 5 minutes. You cannot accept a comment. If you answer in a comment, and the OP says that solved their problem, they may leave the site never to return and leave an answer unaccepted, if the commenter answered with what they had originally posted as a comment.<br />
<sub>(<a href=""https://interpersonal.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1644/31"">Interpersonal Skills meta</a>)</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to mention that you can't get rep from comments.</p>
<p>And you're <em>reminded</em> of this <em>every time you go to write a comment</em>:</p>

<hr />
<p>So now we've determined that writing answers in the comments is a bad idea, not worth it, and directly against site guidelines. So now, despite this, someone didn't feel like writing a full answer and dumped their half-written answer into a convenient textbox that was never intended for anything like that to be put in it.</p>
<p>So now someone comes along, sees the comments, and thinks &quot;Hey, that could be a good answer if I take that information, flesh it out, and source it!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Go for it. By any means.</strong></p>
<p>If someone didn't write out the answer themselves... their loss. They had their opportunity. They chose to write it in the wrong place instead.</p>
<p>You are <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/117268/294691"">perfectly allowed</a> to take that comment, flesh it out, and turn it into a proper answer. Since it had no business being posted in the comments in the <em>first</em> place, you're helping the site by moving the information into an answer.</p>
<p><strong>This is a question and answer site</strong>, not a question and answer and half-answer site. All information should be collected into a question and an answer.</p>
<p>There's no requirement to make an answer that you took from a comment community wiki, but you're free to do that if it'll help your conscience... but hey, if the person who's writing answers as comments sees that you're earning rep from their failure to write a proper answer, perhaps they'll be incentivized to actually write a real answer next time ;).</p>

<p>There have been a few answers recently that were downvoted because they cited sources that can charitably be called ""fringe"".  If you post an answer that is based on controversial scholarship, you run the risk of a dowvote.  Or to put it another way, if you present controversial scholarship as authoritative, then you'll probably get a downvote.  </p>

<p>I want to make an important caveat here.  If you acknowledge that the source is unconfirmed, then only a jerk will downvote.  <em>""Dr X in his paper Y says that baryons are responsible for most economic activity in left handed people.  If this were true, it would answer the question, but nobody has been able to provide a model or experimental evidence.""</em> or <em>""Professor Z argued that the American Revolution was caused by socioeconomic stresses; Profession <strong>Bailyn</strong>'s analysis of pamphlet's undermined this, and Professor Z's views are now in doubt....""</em></p>

<p>Second caveat - hat tip to @langlangC - history is a dialogue, and differentiating between mainstream, alternative and fringe theories is not a simple matter.  I think that @LangLangC provides the best guidance - ""Using only fringe and then declare that as 'the one truth there is/wake up' is entirely different.""  I'd summarize that if you acknowledge the dialogue, then downvotes are jerks, but if you assert that your truth is the only truth, then downvotes are likely, and quite probably legitimate.</p>

<p>That said, I think it should be permitted to politely point out that an answer is based on sources that are not generally accepted, or that are otherwise controversial.  (in point of fact, my answers on economic history come from an analytical perspective that is not universally accepted, and I have thanked those who point out my bias).</p>

<h2>Fix</h2>

<ul>
<li>If you know your sources are debateable, acknowledge that fact</li>
<li>If someone questions whether your source is mainstream, engage with the facts, not the person.</li>
<li>If you feel that an answer relies on sources that are questionable, politely 
point out the grounds for discussion.</li>
<li>This is not the place to push an ideology; there are innumerable forums on the internet, and it is cheap to create a new one on your own.  There is a place for every discussion.  H:SE may not be the place, and downvotes are a legitimate signal that the scholarship in question are not mainstream enough to be welcome here.  </li>
</ul>

Where to draw it can arguably be debated to death. Personally, I'd usually draw it at when a generation or two has come to age after the event and its short-term ramifications have all played out to their conclusions. Put another way, an event becomes history when it no longer is a vivid part of a new generation's collective memory.</p>

<p>The point in drawing this line is to give enough time for the dust to settle. Information presented as facts at the time of an event may turn out to be false or incomplete; there can be good calls and misjudgments on the likely effects and legacy of an event; etc. When there are enough adults in the street who weren't born when an event and its short-term ramifications were in full motion, methinks everyone can agree the event is history; before that, it's still a current event in my opinion.</p>

<p>This definition, as an aside, makes where to draw the line very fuzzy depending on the event and its significance. Indeed, some events can stay current for a very long time.</p>

<p>I'd argue that 9/11, for instance, is still a current event to a large degree in the sense that what its immediate aftereffects (the war on terror, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, etc.) arguably are still in full motion. I can still vividly remember the before and the after 9/11; methinks it'll take another generation or two before we can all agree it should be filed under history.</p>

<p>Similarly, I'd put forward that the GD and WW2 stayed current events for a very long time - possibly over two generations. As an anecdote, my parents grew up into adults that carried over - albeit to a much lesser degree - the obsessions of their own parents with having little to no debt in case of job loss, a garden in case of food shortages, and a chimney in case of fuel shortages. Both were born a few years <em>after</em> WW2, but the scars of the latter took a while to disappear.</p>

<p>I think we can agree that the crowd giggle during the Royal Wedding is someone cracking a joke at one point with the joke not getting picked up by any microphones. We might learn what the joke was in a few weeks or months or years - assuming ever - when someone who actually witnessed the event discusses it.</p>

<p>As for your Sephardic peoples question, the laws were passed only a few years ago - which in government time is just about yesterday. Government sites might have some raw numbers, hence my suggestion to ask in Politics. But for the rest, I'm fairly certain we'll need a generation or two to get enough witness accounts of how things went before anyone is able to unequivocally say proof of descent was easier or harder than jumping through administrative hoops. (Plus it most certainly varies with the family.)</p>

<p>Many of the questions Aaron asked <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/california"">on California</a> revolve around primary sources or such fine grain details that only someone who actively studied the topic might know (or know where to look) the answer off the top of their head.

<p>Therein lies the rub in my view. I too found the question esoteric enough that reaching out to people who will likely know the answer strikes me as more appropriate than asking on Stack Exchange.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no delay after an event before records are manifest. Information like chronologies and measurements are in the historical record immediately.</p>

<p>Yes, some records become available immediately. Others take longer. In the example of the Royal wedding, the video was live, and so part of the record was indeed immediate. However, here in the UK we are still being bombarded with adverts for ""<em>the special souvenir issue</em>"" of this or that magazine, and stories about the event are still appearing as ""<em>news</em>"" items in broadcast and print media.</p>

<p>In fact, it takes time for the historical record to become established.</p>

<ul>
<li>On the one hand we have the ""<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-42487425"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fake news</a>"" stories that proliferate on social media. An example of this was the claim that the death-toll in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenfell_Tower_fire"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fire at Grenfell Tower</a> in June 1017 was actually in the hundreds and that the authorities were covering this up. We now know that 81 people died in the fire. However, it was almost 3 weeks after the fire before the police and fire service were able to give a definitive figure. The public enquiry into the fire has just started, 11 months later.</li>
<li>On the other, we have genuine human error, when facts are reported in error. This latter category is not something new. A famous example being the Chicago Daily Tribune headline <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Defeats_Truman"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dewey Defeats Truman</a> in November 1948.</li>
</ul>

<p>These types of story both form part of the historical record, but it can take time before they are recognised for what they are and we understand where they should fit within the historical narrative.</p>

<p>I would say that the 1948 US Presidential election definitely counts as history. The Grenfell Tower fire is still a current event, and the ongoing public enquiry means that it will probably remain a current event for some time to come - possibly years.</p>

<p>And the Royal wedding? Well, that certainly still <em>feels</em> like a current event. At this moment, I think that the historical record is still being written, and so it may be too soon to apply historical methods in order answer questions about the event.</p>

<hr>

<p>I don't think there can be any rule about when events pass from the realm of '<em>current events</em>' into the domain of '<em>history</em>'. It depends on the nature of the events. It may be weeks or months. It may be years. Sometimes it may even be decades.</p>

<p>But even though the old adage maintains that <em>today's newspapers are tomorrow's fish &amp; chip wrappers</em>, I'm not sure that the boundary between '<em>current events</em>' and '<em>history</em>' can ever be just a few days.</p>

<p>H:SE is a community moderated site, and I think the community has reached a consensus; I've stated it above for simplicity of future reference, but I reserve the right to articulate a minority opinion before I conform to the norm.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>many current events questions are ""what happened"" - factual questions that are out of scope on the ""too basic' rule.  I mention this only to exclude this class, because if the event is not trivial, then the following factors become more important.  </p></li>
<li><p>Discussion of current events generally takes place in the context of incomplete information.  Current events usually rely on the interpretation of a single source, and almost by definition there are active participants who want to suppress, shape or control that source.  If the event isn't trivial, then the meaning and significance of the event is under discussion by multiple parties. History is in the process of being written by the victors.  </p></li>
<li><p>Discussion of current events generally has few secondary and no tertiary sources. There is no way to distinguish between ""current events"", ""propaganda"" and ""fake news"".  There is no analysis or interpretation of events, merely assertions by sources with agendas.  I started to include here an example of a story I remember being reported on a major news media outlet that turned out to be entirely fictitious; but if I provide the details, this will degenerate into a political discussion of those particular events.  What makes history interesting is analyzing the events of the past to better understand the present.  I believe that analyzing the events of the present to understand the present is a different activity (might be called journalism, might be called navel-gazing).   Mixing this with history diminishes the value of both.</p></li>
<li><p>I actively reject the notion that everything that happened more than 1 attosecond ago is history; history is a narrative we construct. History is a verb; it is the process of understanding events.  If history were a simple recounting of events, then it would be impossible to have Marxist historians and Feminist historians and Whig historians - history would be objective, and clear (quite frankly, there would be no college level courses in history, and no degrees in history).  If history were just events, then it would be so boring as to not merit a stack exchange.  Asserting that anything that happened is history is tantamount to saying that math is just counting. </p></li>
<li><p>I have previously argued that if the answer is derived from historical sources and methods, then it is a history question, but if the answer is derived from rhetorical methods, it is current events.  An analysis of the any sequence events can be either historical, rhetorical or political depending on the tools used for analysis.  There is no bright line between the analysis; which is why the site is community moderated; we rely on consensus of the participants.  I'd argue that we should continue to do so.  If we find a specific question to be historical, then it is; if we find it to be current events, then for the purposes of this SE, it is.  </p></li>

<p>It may have been the start of an answer, even a good one? But it falls short of actually answering the question.</p>

<p>First, there is no explanation given to what these ""ancient words"" might mean, what their etymology might mean/reveal. Wheter their meaning/etymology in separation or in combination. You are the curator of your sources and references. You give us none.</p>

<p>to which the vast majority of your readers (who are ""spoon fed"" the wrong ideas, as you wrote) will retort: ""and this distinct meaning is: what, exactly?""</p>

<p>Then, I have to assume, you claim that these syllables were used way before Amerigo/Waldseemüller to refer to anything, in the conjunction as they are used now (""today""). That might be the case, I do not know either way, but we do not get any evidence for that, either. And since I already had to assume this motive, my reading might have gone off the rails already. </p>

<p>There is a certain contradiction in the way you claim that these small facts you present are somehow self-evident and at the same time too obscure for most people to even know and even to strange to write down in the answer?</p>

<li>explain what thee syllables/words did mean in antiquity or do mean now (quotes welcome again)</li>
<li>describe, analyse, explain: how, where, when, by whom these words were connected to the very roughly interpreted frame of the question –– or whether that usage has demonstrably changed some point in time </li>

<p>Genocide is recognized as a crime against humanity; modern cultures jointly condemn the practice.  Asking or answering questions about genocide should be accompanied by clear, respectful thought.

<p>Every genocide is comprised of multiple acts of violence; massacres, deportation, displacement, murder and other acts of physical and moral violence.  The noun can only be recognized when the verbs are studied.  Genocide is a collective, persistent action. Transforming genocide into a verb reduces it to something simple and banal, which removes the horror.  Stalin was wrong; the difference between murder and genocide is not the difference between a tragedy and a statistic, and confusing the two will not lead to learning or understanding.   </p>

<p>Genocide is a crime - crimes require intent and action.  Genocide is a collective crime; it is not possible for an individual to commit genocide, it requires institutions.  Genocide is not an accident, it is a strategy.</p>

These questions must be expressed precisely, must clearly outline the desired answer and should be respectful of all participants.  In practice this means that the question must be expressed in academic, detached, scholarly language, and avoid lurid sensation.</p>

<p>The comment policy is formulated quite strictly and enforced with varying adherence to that strictness, but certainly not followed too loosely on this site and my impression is that the mods do use their mops quite effectively and efficiently; that is the system seems to work relatively well (also in comparison with other sites). If chit-chat appears, and I've seen it appear from high-rep users and even mods as well, then it nearly always disappears into oblivion quite quickly.</p>

<p>That said, I often find the comments quite valuable on their own, in conjunction with the answer or in their own right (I know that this is also a conceptual problem). But the change proposed is mainly designed to do one thing: reduce the number of comments. Well, ""reduce the number of  [low quality] comments"" is the stated goal, but the result to be expected is the overall number of comments being reduced.</p>

<p>Finally, low quality comments emerge and have to be seen as a social problem: people not knowing or consciously violating the rules; rephrasing a button text to nudge people into better behaviour is an attempt to fix social problems with technology. People inclined to agree to that might want to read

<li><p>the phrase ""I find it very hard to imagine"" is,  in my experience, associated with low quality questions. Imagination indicates that you're advancing an alternate theory of history, but it is strongly associated with questions where the author wants to substitute ""imagine"" for ""research"".  </p></li>
<li><p>You're asking two different questions - (a) Was Japan interested in the Japanese population? and (b) Are all prior historians wrong in assuming Japan attacked Hawaii for strategic reasons.   I don't think either question is as strong as directly asking ""Which analysis of Japan's motivation is more strongly supported by evidence?"" - a question that can be researched.</p></li>
<li><p>The question confuses propaganda with reality. Germany claimed to attack the Sudentenland to protect the Germany speaking population, but I think it is pretty clear that their objectives were world domination and genocide from the start.    This leads the question to privilege the racial purity argument and to undercut the plausibility of the strategic objective.   This makes it difficult to engage with the question directly &amp; honestly.  </p></li>
<li><p>You're asking about Japan, but using Germany's actions to support your analysis; that's questionable at best.  Japan and Germany were (at least to my reading) more partners of convenience than ideology.  I think I've read something recently about internal German commentary on their view of the value of the Japanese alliance (which was pretty low).</p></li>

It seems they were replaced with immediate upvotes. Securing those questions a spot on the Hot Network Question (HNQ) list. </p>

<p>HNQs can have quite pleasant effects: reputation for the posters, exposure for the site on the network etc. </p>

<p>But this has also effects that seem concerning:</p>

<p>This site gets outside exposure on the network primarily with low quality questions, which attract often quite a bunch of votes, newbie answers of comparable quality lacking sources and so on.<br>
While HNQs are primarily about popularity of the topic, not about the quality of the posts, and the results predictable, <em>we</em> place those posts on that list. Before there is time to improve the post (that is: <em>if</em> the original poster improves the question along the lines we should desire) a huge bandwagon of voters has already stampeded over the whole thread – distorting the StackExchange voting model and this site's standards.</p>

<p>Why? Why are there so widely differing standards on posts sometimes requesting prior research and requesting sources in questions or answers? Shouldn't we aim at a little more consistency on desirable quality standards?</p>

<hr>

<p>As a rule of thumb I would say that if a question is low quality, like ""does not show prior research effort"" we should seriously restrain us from upvoting too quickly. Assuming that as the main reason for HNQ placement.<br>
As a second rule of thumb I would say that if an answer has ""no sources"" a ""sources would improve this answer"" <em>banner</em> should always be added.<br>
As a third rule of thumb I suppose that an answer that is judged as ""good enough as to not needing sources"" then the question falls automatically into the category of ""too basic"" and should be closed.</p>

<hr>

<p>It seems that the hotness algorithm is not fully published and different for different sites (depending on its size on the network) and different for the sidebar and the hot notwork page.

<p>From what I understand about this it seems clear that the huge disproportionate voting effects from HNQ only start to pile in once <em>we</em> upvoted a poor question quickly, after <em>we</em> answer such a question quickly and then upvote that answer equally quickly. The situation gets worse if there are multiple answers.</p>

<p>The conclusions to draw from that seem difficult. I guess we do not want to stifle HNQ effects completely and especially not for relatively new users. But how to organise the community better into knowing this, into restraint for quick voting and quick answering.<br>
And how to work with that algorithm?:<br>
A question might be ""bad"" but with a good core. Holding that quickly will 
prevent it from going hot forever, despite the core and perhaps the eventually fixed version deserving a wide audience.</p>

<p>Many of their books are properly OCRed and searchable, often from or also found on University of Michigan, Hathi Trust or archive.org and others.

<p>That alone means almost any other source is preferable to Google Books.</p>

<hr>

<p>While a direct link to the exact place within a text that is available digitised within Google Books seems like a great service to the reader I suspect Google is not trustworthy enough to rely on this company keeping its APIs stable forever.</p>

<p>That means an URL linking to Google books should strive to be as human readable as possible.</p>

<p>Therefore I suggest to cite specific passages in Google Books like an ordinary book: with an <a href=""https://support.google.com/books/partner/answer/3474239"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ID like ISBN</a> or the proprietary Google-ID for books and optionally (or at least) including the page number:</p>

<p>in this case </p>

<pre><code> https://books.google.com/books?id=hk5fhp-rhsMC&amp;pg=PT122
</code></pre>

<p>But keep in mind that Google books has different value for people with different IPs. Without a way to spoof that people might not be able really see the highlighted serch terms anyway.</p>

<p>Converting the usually ""complicated for spying on you"" Google-URL into this format is currently made easy by using for example the <a href=""http://reftag.appspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia citation tool for Google Books</a>. Of course, this might also always be done manually with the current format Google chose…</p>

<p>Speaking of geo-IP phenomena: it looks as if the .com domain always redirects 'properly' to other local domains like .hu, .ph, .de, .uk, etc.  </p>

<p>However, the reverse seems not to be working so well. That is, using a local domain in another location might not work as expected (like clicking on a .ph domain while being in .uk) Therefore it seems advisable to always link to the .com-domain address (by just removing the localising part or substituting it with .com  </p>

<p>[ <code>*.google.com.ph/* to *.google.com/* or 
*.google.de/* to *google.com/*</code> ]</p>

<p>Just copying the URL from the address bar of a browser as presented produces a rather complicated string:</p>

<p>But that can be simplified a bit, using the tools Google provides now.</p>

<p>You get either this version A:</p>

<p><code>https://books.google.com/books?id=hk5fhp-rhsMC&amp;lpg=PT122&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CMongols%2C%20having%20already%20conquered%20half%20of%20Europe%2C%20decided%20the%20other%20half%20wasn't%20worth%20it%E2%80%9D%3F&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PT122#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CMongols,%20having%20already%20conquered%20half%20of%20Europe,%20decided%20the%20other%20half%20wasn't%20worth%20it%E2%80%9D?&amp;f=false</code></p>

<p>or a much shorter and therefore nicer version B:     </p>

<p><code>https://books.google.com/books?id=hk5fhp-rhsMC&amp;lpg=PT122&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CMongols%2C%20having%20already%20conquered%20half%20of%20Europe%2C%20decided%20the%20other%20half%20wasn't%20worth%20it%E2%80%9D%3F&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PT122</code></p>

<p>The last option even retains the desired highlights from the search parameters.
It is generated by Google when you use the ""chain link"" icon in the middle of the toolbar, the extreme right in the following screenshot:</p>

<p>and choose not  ""Paste link in IM or email"" for version A;<sub><br></sub>
but the second option offered: <strong><em>""embed""</em></strong> for version B. </p>

<p>Since the buffer is then filled with:<br>

<p>As far as I understand the issue with URL shorteners:<br>
Those should never be used. And those should especially never be used on this network. They are not only a potential security risk, they also add complexity and round trip time to the link, they obfuscate the destination, make locating the source by hand or on archive.org harder and are easily gone completely, when the shortener service is no longer ""in service"".<br>
Those kind of links might not need to be hunted down now, but I strongly suggest to convert them into regular links whenever anyone encounters them during an edit. </p>

<hr>

<p>The above gives methods for linking to Google books. But it remains the best way to link to books is <em>not to link to Google books!</em></p>

<p>Therefore a little redundancy: Most older books and quite few recent books are also found on <a href=""https://archive.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://archive.org</a>. Please always try to link to better sources than Google books! </p>

<p>However, I think you have the voting situation reversed. What in fact happens, I believe, is that a question become HNQ, and <em>then</em> receive a bunch of upvotes, probably because most HNQ viewers can only upvote. It seems to only take a couple of votes from History to start the process.</p>

<p>Instead, notice that questions do not become HNQ without being answered. So the key here is actually that <strong>we're answering poor questions too quickly.</strong> Poor questions by their nature invites quick answers: we've all seen ones that do nothing but cite Wikipedia articles, or one that simply correct basic misunderstandings, or worse (but thankfully rarely), ""answers"" that simply wonder what an unclear question actually meant.</p>

<p>The proper way to prevent this is to put the question on hold. This is something the community has tended to be reluctant to do, even when the same users leave comments requesting changes or clarifications. Hence, the present issue.</p>

<p>Therefore, <strong>the community needs to be proactive about putting subpar questions on hold.</strong> Fix the question, nominate for reopening, and <em>then</em> answer it.</p>

<p><sub>Alternatively, it's also possible for the moderators to adopt a more pro-active stance and preemptively put questions on hold pending edits. A substantial change like this would have to be supported by community consensus, though.</sub></p>

  <p>@MarkC.Wallace I acknowledge that things must look very different from a mod perspective, but StackExchange is still (so far as I've seen in meta) committed to being transparent and democratic -- something that, so long as I've got your ear, I'd like to suggest sits uneasily with sometimes feels like inscrutable, even arbitrary, close votes. At the very least, not giving explanation must be incompatible with the idea that holds are first and foremost meant to give a user time to correct their question rather than to shut it down, a really laudable point I saw you express in a comment recently. In short, if some users cant help but make @$$#$ of themselves, surely the answer is to disengage with, show zero-tolerance to, or pile close votes onto them, rather than effectively punish all users, esp. new ones? The latter also gives cover to users with voting privileges to (perhaps) start using them a bit more whimsically, and (perhaps) a lot more often than they might if all felt more accountable to debate and site rules. In that I want to suggest close votes should be treated more like the vote of a representative than the secret ballot of a citizen. Thanks for your time! – Era        </p>
  
  <p>You make good points. Unfortunately the amount of personal abuse I've suffered for explaining votes has persuaded me not to touch the hot stove again.

<p>I think Era said it very well, and in my private discussions on the topic, the consensus of opinion supports his position.   Let me reiterate some of the key points:</p>

<ol>
<li>Votes on H:SE are inherently valid.  My vote based on telepathic advice from my pet goldfish is just as valid as @ExampleUser's vote based on his PhD thesis on the subject in question.  That is what community moderation means.  (we could discuss the law of large numbers, and statistical significance, but the ground rules wouldn't change).  If you accept the SE model, you accept the possibility that the community will moderate without explanation. </li>
<li>Votes are feedback, but they're not very granular; explanations are granular.  Consequently if we want posters to have feedback, we want to encourage votes coupled with feedback.</li>
<li>History [<em>sic</em>] proves that if I explain my vote, OP will respond that I am wrong, stupid and morally bankrupt, and then go on a rant about my personal hygiene.

<hr>

<p>Firstly, it is not at all clear from your answer why you think that the date of printing the modern Bible has anything to do with the date that the Book of Ezekiel was written, or its historical veracity.</p>

<p>It is even less clear to me why you think the story of Noah and the flood has anything at all to do with this question.</p>

<p>From the context, I <em>suspect</em> that the point you are trying to make is simply that the Bible is, at best, an unreliable historical source. </p>

<p>If that is the case, then I'd suggest that you simply say so and pick one of the many available <em>reliable</em> sources to cite and support your case.  If your point is supposed to be something different, then I'd suggest that this part of your answer probably needs to be re-written with clear and reliable sources that support the point you are trying to make.</p>

<hr>

<p>We then come to some rather more specific and problematic cases.</p>

<p>Your claim that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The Ancient Egyptian civilization is at least 25,000 years old, as reflected in the procession of the equinoxes encoded into the so-called ""Giza complex"", where the Great Pyramid of Khufu still stands""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is entirely unsupported by the sources that you cite. As far as I can see, not one of your 3 sources actually makes that claim.</p>

<p>[As an aside, I'd generally recommend that if you're going to cite multiple sources in that way, you should at least do your readers the courtesy of placing them on seperate lines, so that it is easy to see they are, actually, <em>seperate</em> sources.]</p>

<p>In fact, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt#History"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ancient Egyptian civilisation</a> is generally accepted to have originated in the Neolithic with the Faiyum A culture in Lower Egypt (with evidence dating back to about 6000 BCE), and the Badari culture, which has given us the earliest evidence of agriculture and permanent settlement in Upper Egypt dating to around 5000 BCE.  These were followed by the more-familiar Naqada cultures.</p>

<p>If you wish to make the claim that ""<em>The Ancient Egyptian civilization is at least 25,000 years old</em>"", <strong>you are going to need to support that claim with some fairly solid evidence</strong>. As it stands you have presented no such evidence. <strong>A citation of some sort (preferably something reliable) is therefore required for this assertion</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>You then state that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""At some point western academia states that those original African people mated with the different species Neanderthal, and Denisovan.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, you don't cite a source for this claim. Again, this is a problem.</p>

<p>Now, I'm fully aware of the current debate about whether Neanderthals should be considered a sub-species of Homo Sapiens, <em>Homo sapiens neanderthalensis</em>, or an entirely separate species, <em>Homo neanderthalensis</em>.  I'm not at all sure that everyone who visits this site and reads your answer will also share that awareness.</p>

<p>That debate is ongoing and as yet is not settled, so if you wish to make this claim then <strong>you are going to have to back it up with evidence</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>[In fact, those who wish to argue that they are separate species face a problem in that, part of the definition of a species is that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""... organisms within a species produce fertile offspring"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since we now have DNA evidence that Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens <em>did</em> in fact produce fertile offspring (even if that turns out to have been limited to the female line), that means that they must have been the same species <em>by the current definition of the term ""species""</em>.</p>

<p>Now, it may well be that the definition of <em>species</em> actually needs to be refined in the light of new evidence from sources like DNA. Eventually, it may come down to a simple matter of semantics, but in any event, the debate is ongoing.  What is clear is that the new evidence is revealing a more nuanced reality through the research efforts of <em>modern western academia and modern western science</em>.]</p>

<hr>

<p>I was under the impression that we had dealt with the claims that you make about DNA evidence and Ramesses III in my <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/47382/24858"">answer</a> to your previous question.</p>

<p>In short, the article by David Sepuya Kalanzi does not accurately reflect the report by DNA Tribes.  What they actually said in their <a href=""http://dnatribes.com/dnatribes-digest-2013-02-01.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Digest, dated 1 February 2013</a>, was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These results indicate that both Ramesses III and Unknown Man E (possibly his son Pentawer) shared an ancestral component with present day populations of Sub-Saharan Africa. This preliminary analysis based on eight STR markers does not identify the percentages of Sub-Saharan African ancestry for these ancient individuals. This preliminary analysis also does not exclude additional ancestral components (such as Near Eastern or Mediterranean related components) for these ancient pharaonic Egyptians.</p>
  
  <p>In addition, these DNA match results in present day world regions might in part express population changes in Africa after the time of Ramesses III. In particular, DNA matches in present day populations of Southern Africa and the African Great Lakes might to some degree reflect genetic links with ancient populations (formerly living closer to New Kingdom Egypt) that have expanded southwards in the Nilotic and Bantu migrations of the past 3,000 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, the post notice states, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please edit to add citations to <em>reliable</em> sources that support the assertions made here.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>my emphasis</li>
</ul>

<p>In this context, the <em>source</em> used by a journalist will always be considered to be more reliable than any article they write.  Given my answer to your previous question, it might be considered disingenuous at best to cite the same (unreliable) source here in the same context.</p>

<p>In fact, the <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15694.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">latest DNA analysis</a> that I'm aware of (involving 166 samples from 151 mummified individuals), which provides:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""the first reliable data set obtained from ancient Egyptians using high-throughput DNA sequencing methods and assessing the authenticity of the retrieved ancient DNA via characteristic nucleotide misincorporation patterns and statistical contamination tests to ensure the ancient origin of [the] data""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>found that <strong><em>the ancient Egyptians actually most closely resembled ancient and modern Near Eastern and European populations, especially those in the Levant</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Now, this is entirely consistent with the claims made in the actual report from DNA Tribes, given the caveats I quoted above, but would seem to make a complete nonsense of the article that you have cited as your source.  Again, a <em>reliable</em> citation would be required to support your claim.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are also some other less-glaring instances that, in my opinion, would benefit from additional (reliable) citations - more for the benefit of those less familiar with the subject than because the points are particularly contentious.  However, in my experience instances like these would not usually result in the answer being flagged by our users, and so receiving a post notice from a moderator.</p>

<p>I hope you find this feedback helpful.</p>

<hr>

<p>Perhaps your question does raise one important point though. It is possible that the wording of the post notice should be made more clear.  Maybe the final sentence should read something like:</p>

<p>Using that alone would not constitute an improvement in my eyes. It does however focus slightly different and thereby emphasises the principle of abstaining from cargo-cult-citations. </p>

<p>Without knowing the character and format limits I am unsure to suggest a rewording myself here. That's why this meta post asks for further input.</p>

<p><strong>In any case:</strong> To avoid too much discussion generated just by this ""post notice"", or even a rephrased notice, and to work around any character limit, I strongly suggest to include a link in the notice to another meta-post – that is still to be created – that gives a bit more explanation on the reasons why the notice appears and that would suggest possible solutions to get it removed.</p>

<p>The Bible is not a historical document, period. The Bible, <strong>including all of its content</strong> is completely historically worthless, <strong>without exception</strong>.

<p>The first humans did not know how long a solar year was until the first solar year that they observed completed. The same reasoning applies to procession of the equinoxes being encoded into the so-called ""Giza complex"".</p>

<p>That is, the only way for the African Ancient Egyptians to accurately or approximately calculate the procession of the equinoxes, or the Great Year, is the have actually have observed the entire cycle.</p>

<p>A comma or semi-colon suffices to separate sources.</p>

<p>""genreally accepted"" does not preclude the possibility that what is ""generally accepted"" is simply inaccurate; wrong; or intentionally misleading misinformation.</p>

<p>In this case, the above simple reasoning establishes the fact that one cannot accurately or approximately calculate the procession of the equinoxes without actually observing the complete cycle of the procession of the equinoxes <em>at least once</em>: approximately 26,000 years.</p>

<p>Since western academia states that all human life originated in Africa, those first humans who traveled ""out of Africa"" were still indigenous Africans, and remained so.

  <p><strong>Genetic Analysis</strong></p>
  
  <p>Geographical analysis of Ramesses III and Unknown Man E (possibly
  Ramesses’ son Pentawer) was performed using their autosomal STR
  profiles based on eight tested loci.9,10 Results are summarized in
  Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 2-3.</p>
  
  <p>Discussion: Results in Table 1 indicate that the autosomal STR
  profiles for both <strong>Ramesses</strong> and Unknown Man E <strong>are most frequent
  in present day regions of Sub-Saharan Africa</strong> and also found in Near
  Eastern regions at lower frequencies.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Among present day world populations, Ramesses III’s autosomal STR profile is most frequent in the African Great Lakes region</strong>, where it
  is approximately 335.1 times as frequent as in the world as a whole
  (see Table 1 and Figure 2). Unknown Man E’s autosomal STR profile is
  most frequent in the Southern Africa region, where it is approximately
  134.6 times as frequent as in the world as whole (see Table 1 and Figure 3). Both autosomal STR profiles are also found in the Levantine
  region that includes populations of present day Egypt, but are
  substantially more frequent in regions of Sub-Saharan Africa (see
  Table 1). Specifically, both of these ancient individuals inherited
  the alleles D21S11=35 and CSFIPO=7, which are found throughout
  Sub-Saharan Africa but are comparatively rare or absent in other
  regions of the world. These African related alleles are different from
  the African related alleles identified for the previously studied
  Amarna period mummies (D18S51=19 and D21S11=34).11 This provides
  independent evidence for African autosomal ancestry in two different
  pharaonic families of New Kingdom Egypt.</p>

<p>If there is a scholarly disagreement as to the facts and <em>interpretation</em> relevant to the DNA analysis, then so be it. The study of history is rife with disagreement and different interpretation of facts. No one is under the compulsion to accept <em>your</em> interpretation of facts. Especially when your interpretation is being construed here as inherently biased towards a non-sub-Sarahan origin of the African Ancient Egyptians, or the view that people need to ""wait"" for some other group of people to ""settle"" their own disagreements; and to be direct, your analysis of the available data relevant to the subject matter is substantially incorrect and historically inaccurate.</p>

<p>No, your feedback is not helpful relevant to the defacing label you and the group of users and moderators who have decided to pursue your agenda of defacing users' posts with ridiculous defacing labels. Just stop doing it.</p>

For instance, I was considering adding some or all of these: Dwight-Eisenhower, Douglas-MacArthur, Omar-Bradley, George-Patton, Anthony-McAuliffe, Chester-Nimitz, William-Halsey, Ernest-King, Jack-Fletcher, Raymond-Spruance, Hermann-Göring, Heinrich-Himmler, Albert-Speer, Martin-Bormann, Rudolph-Hess, Adolf-Eichmann, Reinhard-Heydrich, Erwin-Rommel, Alfred-Jodl, Karl-Dönitz, Bernard-Montgomery, Hugh-Dowding, Harold-Alexander, Louis-Mountbatten, Hideki-Tojo, Isoroku-Yamamoto, Georgy-Zhukov, Ivan-Konev, Aleksandr-Vasilevsky… </p>

<p>&quot;Adding a tag&quot; can mean two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding an existing tag to a question, or re-tagging</li>
<li>Adding a non-existing to a question, or tag creation</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking through the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/tags"">existing tags</a> reveals that there are a few tags for individual persons: like Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler; but not for Dwight Eisenhower or your other suggestions.</p>
<p>What you seem to have in mind is therefore more like case 2: adding newly created tags to the system and some individual questions?</p>
<p>Generally there are a few pointers for general advice on how to use tags here:</p>
<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/tagging"">What are tags, and how should I use them?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a general rule, you should avoid creating new tags if possible, and new users are not allowed to create new tags. Even if you have sufficient reputation, you should only create new tags when you feel you can make a strong case that your question covers a new topic that nobody else has asked about before on this site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here on History Help Center.<br />
Then there are the network wide meta posts:</p>
<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/18878/how-do-i-correctly-tag-my-questions"">How do I correctly tag my questions?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try not to create new tags. If you create a new tag, that tag is guaranteed not to help your question show up on any subscribed RSS feeds or interesting tag lists. Again, the look-ahead prompt can help with this. Odds are it also means you're missing an existing tag for that topic that would more accurately categorize your question.</p>
<p><strong>Retagging</strong></p>
<p>Retagging a question is making any edit to a question that changes the tags.</p>
<p>Do not retag a question if you are not going to add value to the question information by doing so.
Do retag questions to use well-known and popular tags that are appropriate for the question.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/31776/why-do-we-tag-questions"">Why do we tag questions?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tags connect experts with questions they will be able to answer.</strong> If you tag your SQL Server question 'mssql' instead of 'sql-server', odds are it won't get as much attention and may not get a great answer, because frequent users who use SQL Server have favorited the 'sql-server' tag. They know to watch the sql-server tag for questions they can answer, but are not necessarily watching for mssql. A good rule of thumb is that any tag used less than 10 times is probably wrong, and any major language or product tag used less than 100 times is also probably wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Tags are for sorting your question into specific, well-defined categories.</strong> Each tag should by itself refer to a specific category. If a tag only makes sense when used in combination with another tag (like '2005' with 'sql-server', 'visual' with 'studio', or '3.5' with '.net'), it's a meta tag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above does not mean that you should refrain from creating and adding tags at all. It does mean that you should exercise frugality and minimalism when creating tags.</p>
<p>It is therefore indeed <em>not</em> a good idea to now go on a spree and re-tag-create every question you see might fit. Also for reasons of those questions then all bouncing to the top of the homepage, cluttering the 'really active' posts: questions that are being posed and answered.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb I'd suggest here that if there are three or better yet five separate questions that would benefit from such a tag you might go ahead with it. I am undecided whether all of your personalities should receive a tag, some may not be that important (yet?) on this site to justify such actions, some might already have such a tag.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that just because a person is connected to the question or a possible answer does <em>not</em> mean the name should appear as a tag then. Tags are to best describe and categorize questions. If that is achieved with a person's name-tag, then do it. Otherwise you might just add another appropriate tag, change one to a better fitting one or leave the existing ones in place. If a post does not already have five tags, chances are high the question might benefit from another tag or two.</p>

<li><p><strong>Are deleted posts taken into account too?</strong><br>
If a post was poorly-received (downvoted or closed), that will continue to count against your account even if the post is deleted! Whenever possible, try to fix posts instead of deleting them.</p>

<p>Additionally, deletion itself counts against questions if less than 30 days old when deleted if others have invested time into answering or moderating the question.</p>

<p>Finally, deleted answers always count towards an automatic answer-ban on new accounts - so make sure that you've posted a few well-received answers to counter those you've removed.</p>

<p>It's not a problem to have deleted posts. But if a large percentage of your posts are deleted by yourself or the community, then apparently they are not suitable for the site. Posting them consumes time from users who read them, edit them, or respond to them. Therefore deleted posts have an effect on the filter, among many other factors.</p>

<p>Beware that an account might very well have many deleted posts, including auto-deleted old low-score questions, all of which are only visible to moderators.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How long do I have to wait before I can post again? What can I do to release the ban? How can I reactivate my account?</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Note the emphasis on fixing. Do not delete your posts. As explained above, deleted questions (if less than 30 days old when deleted) do still count towards the question ban. Deleting your posts does not help to lift the ban. Only fixing does! Under some conditions you can see a list of your own deleted questions and answers.</p>

<p>If you're unable to improve your existing questions, you'll get the chance to ask one new one 6 months after your last question. If that question is positively received, you may be able to continue asking questions; if not, then the ban will be reinstated.</p></li>

Some disturbing themes do appear in some cases though, as well as some interesting psychological theories which <em>suggest</em> possible answers after the fact, but the psychological theories don't offer any first-hand responses from the physicians themselves (from interviews, interrogations, testimonies, journals, or memoirs).  </p>

<p>To frame this question without it sounding like a rhetorical question (""how can someone so easily abandon such a sacred oath?"" or ""how can one hold an oath to Hitler as a member of the SS in such high regard while at the same time rejecting an earlier oath to do no harm?"" - etc.), or without it sounding like I am seeking opinions from others (either forum members here, or others who have studied the topic after the fact without conferring with the primary sources), I have found myself having to write paragraphs and paragraphs of explanations and disclaimers.

This works reasonably well on comparatively minor problems with questions, borderline cases of on/off topic, interesting theme but suboptimal focus. This works not so good if a question is from a novice user, blatantly off-topic, or wholly unclear for the original asker. If it is so quite clear for the asker and just sloppy in phrasing it, this can be remedied quickly. If the topic is in an area attracting controversy, like Trump, Germany, Nazis, race etc. this approach is less than ideal as the downvotes come immediately. And frankly, with these kinds of topics, a question simply has to start on a somewhat solid  footing.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask in chat. This is nice as it avoids the possible downvotes and is usually quite quick and interactive to exchange a few simple ideas and suggestions. If it's likely to result in a big exchange, you can create a separate chatroom just for this purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask on meta. This seems to be new as most come here after posting on main. This is somewhat difficult as it is really meta-meta since an answer here has to try to a certain extant to avoid posting the actual question and the actual answers in the likely ensuing back-and-forth of comments and edits. But this is likely the most powerful of the options listed so far. The above methods can be combined as needed.</p></li>

<p><strong>Re: the actual question for main:</strong></p>

<p>Post length should not be a problem. There is a hard limit enforced by the system and I never hit it just by writing something. There are people on main writing longer posts than I do and they still get their readers and votes. The adage ""if I had more time I would have written a shorter post"" is of course not be dismissed and shows that you care for the reader. ""Keep it simple"", stupid was better defined by Einstein: ""make it as simple as possible, bit not too simple"". If an information is strictly necessary, include it.</p>

<p>In trying to keep it answerable describe your question, research and preliminary reasoning, your problems with it. As I read the question here combined with my point 1 from above it's already almost 'launchable'. </p>

<p>Main remaining problems seem to be language and opinion attraction. I think the language problem should be solvable, easily, with quick edits –– if there indeed remain problems. Currently it looks as if a thoughtful person is on the way of posting a good question with a great and interesting topic. To keep it factual, I'd suggest here to ask about written out psychological or psychiatrical assessments that deal with the subject on the one hand and possibly just the diaries or memoirs of the perpetrators or their helpers, family etc. The personal opinion of answerers will kreep [sic!] in anyway, but I think this approach will keep that down a bit.</p>

<p>There may be a structural problem you perceive with your posts so far. I do not have much other than general advice for that here: start with the biggest, most important and filter it down, keeping a recognisable thread running through it.</p>

<p>I could find no references online to Thrace occupying Algeria, and the claim that ""Thracia occupied all England and they have made cities and many things there"", plus the fact that the question is extremely broad, made me vote to close as well. </p>

<p>Actually, I don't usually downvote and vote to close - in fact, I try hard to avoid both. As your question here on meta seems to be a genuine attempt to understand why your question was so poorly received (which makes me think that you do <em>not</em> actually have an agenda), I've removed my downvote. However, I cannot vote to reopen as there are too many problems with your question.</p>

<p>First, you to limit your question to Thrace in relation to one country or area. Then, you need to cite the source of the claim in the question and (if possible) mention another source that supports it.</p>

<p>Next, you should do some googling to see what other sources say. A good place to start is Wikipedia; it's not perfect, but it's a good place to start and most of the articles have been written in good faith and have sources and footnotes.</p>

<p>So, if you want to know about your ancestors, I suggest you start with Wikipedia and work from there. If you find information there that is unclear or which contradicts other sources you have seen, then you can begin to write a question. For example, you could look at my question <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/45466/did-the-romans-eat-breakfast"">Did the Romans eat breakfast?</a>. Also, look at other people's questions, especially more recent ones that got a lot of votes (although some questions get a lot of votes because the topic is popular rather than because the question is good).</p>

<p>You can also ask questions if you want to know more than you have been able to find. For example, you read that King XXX died in battle but there is no information on which battle or where it took place (so you could ask about that battle). Have a look at this question: <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/47683/why-did-the-royal-society-in-1771-believe-that-a-continent-further-south-than-au"">Why did the Royal Society in 1771 believe that a continent further south than Australia should exist?</a>.</p>

<p>I'm wondering what to do about it. It's obviously something that struck me as interesting enough to put into a question here, but other people don't like it and I don't want to get banned from asking questions on this site.</p>

<p>First of all, I don't understand the reason for closing it: <strong>""Questions on social sciences other than History are off-topic here, unless they also involve history in some fashion. While ethics, archaeology, etc. are all connected to history, each field has their own experts who are better equipped to answer such questions.""</strong> Obviously, the question does ""involve history in some fashion""; I am not asking if other people have these nightmares, I am asking about the history of them. However, some of the commenters mentioned questions about ""phobias"" being bad. So I thought maybe I would find something about phobias under <code>help/on-topic</code>, but I didn't. It does say that questions about ""Cultures and historical practices"" are <em>on-topic</em>.</p>

<p>I suppose this is a moot point, if people don't like the question and have been downvoting it, maybe that is more relevant than the fact that it has been closed. Anyway I'm wondering if I should:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Delete the question and forget about it, not waste any more of my time or that of other people</p></li>
<li><p>Include more research showing that this is indeed a modern phenomenon and trying to motivate why it might be interesting to know how long it has existed</p></li>
<li><p>Simplify the question, delete stuff that maybe people found irrelevant</p></li>
<li><p>Move it to a different site</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I thought other people would be interested in this, but I could be biased or unobservant in some way that is clouding my judgment. Maybe I am failing to recognize what great variety of similar questions could be asked, or how difficult it is for a professional to research this topic. This also suggests a sixth option:</p>

<ol start=""6"">
<li>Make it broader and less ambitious, ""How do we investigate the history of [nightmares/underwear/phobias]?""... (if this can be done without inviting mere opinions)</li>
</ol>

<p>There is also</p>

<ol start=""7"">
<li>Leave the question around but keep it off the front page by refraining from commenting on or editing it; maybe someone else who is interested will find it years later and communicate some useful information via a comment</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not sure what is the thinking of moderators or close-voters, maybe there is a legitimate desire to keep certain low-quality questions off the site, and sometimes the various rules are interpreted somewhat creatively to accomplish this; at any rate I can see other questions where it seems this has happened. I am happy to delete it, but I am also curious if there is more to be said. I've never posted on a per-site meta before.</p>

(which limits the answer to only those times in which school is a concept.   It would be interesting to discover that this type of anxiety dream is contemporary with the modern notion of school; it would be equally fascinating to discover evidence that medieval students at the Sorbonne had anxiety dreams.  I can construct narratives that support either, but the trick is to find evidence. </p>

Now, however, my interests have suddenly and temporarily changed and I am desiring in-depth information about a topic in history (a foreign field of study to myself).  </p>

<p>To exemplify, say I want to learn about the Mongolians and their social-cultural interactions and interchanges with other cultures of nations throughout their prehistory and antiquity. This would effectively be their history of developments and influences.  </p>

<p><strong>May I request a canonical resource which most scholars would point to if given the same objective?</strong>  — <strong>Ex.: What is a canonical resource outlying the history of the Mongolians?</strong>  </p>

<p>I understand that this is a heated topic. I've read through a handful of questions debating it, and I can see quite some binary opinions. The main concern is the <em>objectiveness</em> involved with answering a classical Stack Exchange question, specifically, <em>How does the OP pick and choose which answer (of this sort) is most correct</em>?  </p>

<p>History, as I understand it as an outsider, is a branch of knowledge seated firmly on a myriad of sources, each with their own varying degrees of credibility. I am basing my assumption that there exist canonical sources within the subject of history which teachers or scholars would utilize by default, given their canonness, based on those utilized in other sciences. For example, one requesting information on the topic of general relativity may be pointed to the canonical work of Einstein's <em>General Theory of Relativity</em>, or subsequent works of other authors given similar degrees of credibility for their works. In essence, this assumption persists by viewing similar instances through my narrow scope of the sciences.  </p>

<p>Now, that is meant to more or less define what I intended to convey by ""canonical,"" what about the bigger dilemma? How do I, the OP, conclusively state that one answer over the other presents the more canonical source? (Do mind that multiple canonical sources can exist for the same subject.) This seems to me like a roadblock inadvertently created by the field of study itself. That, and I, the one with the freshly plastic cranial meat on the subject, am wholly underprepared to make that conclusion. <em>I</em> don't know which answer is more canonical than another. I have to ascertain, based on the evidence <em>in the answer</em>, that one canonical work reigns over another.  </p>

<p>Surely, this is no sure-fire method, and hence the debate.  </p>

<p>However, given the example of a canonical source that I have made, I want to believe that there is a certain obviousness to that aspect. One source, given the education to make such the deduction, is more credible and widespread than another. If it is not, then perhaps the question is off-topic—no clear solution. 
There will always be the lingering figure of trustworthiness and integrity with any work of nonfiction as discoveries are often disproven. By this, no clear-cut answer to any question exists, and then the discussion diverges into metaphysics.  </p>

<p>I believe I'm getting ahead of myself, so here's a restatement of the question:<br>

<p>As @Sempaiscuba notes, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As for there being accepted definitions of any_race, it's worth noting that _Modern scholarship regards race as a social construct, that is, a symbolic identity created to establish some cultural meaning. While partially based on physical similarities within groups, race is not an inherent physical or biological quality. – from the <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia page on Race (human categorization)</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my opinion this extends not just to ""race"" but to most ""human categorization"".  Human categorization is junk science that has no place on H:SE.</p>

<p>A comment asserts (without citation) that ""Race is very much an inherent physical and biological quantity."" I am unable to find any defensible definition of ""race"".  I believe that ""race"" is like any other word on Stack Exchange; if you're going to use the term, and if the definition is germane, you're going to have to demonstrate that the word is cromulent, and provide uffish citations.  I will be surprised if anyone can meet that standard.</p>

For me the answer is very clear, that the impact is negligible and that given the choice, I'd prefer to incur the cost.  The code of conduct does not mean that we cannot discuss race, discrimination or other unpleasant historical events, it requires that we show sensitivity.

<p>There are three reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
<li>As Mark has pointed out, questions about race will often be in tension with the SE 
code of conduct.</li>
<li>Several questions about race (and a number of answers to these questions) have had 
the <em>appearance</em> of being '<a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3702/24858"">push questions</a>' (or, perhaps, 'push answers') 
intended to ""<em>promote or discredit a specific idea, theory, cause, group or person</em>"", 
and do not appear to be ""<em>a good-faith effort to learn more about history as defined 
in the help centre</em>"".  Citations are obviously essential in such cases.</li>
<li>Most, if not all, of the theories of 'racial origins' developed in the nineteenth 
and early twentieth centuries have now been discarded in the light of modern DNA 
evidence.  <strong>If we are to attempt to answer a question, or judge the merits of an 
answer, we need to know the sources upon which it is based</strong>.  (I'd argue that a 
recent paper published in Nature and based on DNA evidence, for example, will be 
far more credible than one published in the 1930s based on the ""research"" of the 
Ahnenerbe using craniometers and tape measures).</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>To provide concrete examples for the last point, I have seen assertions based on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Sergi"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Giuseppe Sergi</a>'s 1901 book, <em><a href=""https://archive.org/details/mediterraneanrac00serguoft/page/n11"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Mediterranean Race: a Study of the Origins of European Peoples</a></em>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Gabriel_Seligman"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C.

<p>The theories promoted in these books are no longer considered to be supportable by the majority of modern researchers - the 'evidence' that was thought to underpin them having since been disproved by advances in DNA analysis.</p>

<p>A problem arises, of course, when those theories, or extracts from the 'evidence' presented in those texts, are presented without proper citation in support of a question or an answer (or, indeed, in a comment).</p>

<p>That said, longer is absolutely not inherently ""better"". This is not just about the appropriate length for the StackExchange medium, but also about good writing in general. Excessive length wears out the reader's attention and harms the dissemination of information.

<p>Now, Of course, the difficulty lies with determining how much is too much. Unfortunately there is no easy metric for determining this - <strong>writing is not a hard science</strong>. Striking the right balance is a skill acquired with practice. I know that is not particularly helpful, so perhaps examples are more useful.</p>

<p>One example of superfluous length is when an answer incorporates massive quotes. In academic writing, quotations are ""used to clarify some aspect that is being discussed or to substantiate a claim that is made""<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>. In the former case, quotes are only useful if it cannot be paraphrased into meaningfully fewer words. In the latter case, it's only helpful to quote parts that are concise and directly pertinent to the claim.</p>

<p>If the source text does not express an idea succinctly, it is probably not worthwhile to reproduce it, unless you're quoting to establish a reference for discussion. Quotes are not a (good) substitute for writing your own answer.</p>

<p>I originally like your short version answer.  The current version seems to contain answers not asked for.

I would bet that you received your downvotes after the addition of these images. The reddit post you found your second image from asked (unanswered) for a source. An unsourced image from another forum is not strong evidence (no proof of who when and where), and considering the link to this atrocity contains the phrase 'historyPorn' I  find it offensive.</p>

<p>Apparently necessary prolegomena:</p>

<p><strong>What is ""race""?</strong></p>

<p>""Race"" is an either biologic or <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/biologistic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">biologistic</a> system of categorisation or taxonomy for grouping life forms. This was also applied to human pouplations but came to be recognised as scientifically obsolete since the 1950s, as biologistic determinism proved incompatible to explaining greater intragroup variation to lesser intergroup variations in human populations on the one side and shifting weights within the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">nature-nurture debate</a> that lessened emphasis on genetic determinism for individual human development. </p>

<p><strong>What is racism?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Racism is an attitude, belief or ideology according to which people are categorised <em>and</em> judged as so-called ""races"" on the basis of a few external characteristics – which suggest a common descent. The characteristics used for differentiation such as skin colour, body size or language – but also cultural characteristics such as clothing or customs - <strong>are interpreted in their biologistic meaning as a fundamental and determining factor of human abilities and qualities and classified according to their ""value"".</strong> Racists generally regard all people who are as similar as possible to their own characteristics as superior, while all others (often graded) are discriminated against as inferior. With such race theories, which are allegedly scientifically supported, various actions were and are justified, which contradict the general human rights as understood and applied today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, racism is taking a number of minute statistical differences in either behaviour or biology of groups of people and declaring that without basis in sound evidence as essential and deterministic to individuals and populations alike, always carrying a value judgement that is designed to degrade others. As the biology of race is so weak it cannot be a meaningful foundation for justifying the racist outgrouping and dehumanisation that appears sociologically or politically. The human rights issue is just the icing on the cake of scientific dishonesty, although some might prefer to  start their reasoning from there. The result will be the same.</p>

<p>There are just tiny problems here when applying this to History.SE: what exactly is ""promoting racism"" and how do we deal with ignorant (see above) postings? I think there can be cases when a posting can be improved to comply to guidelines; from ""can be read as being racist content"" to ""tackles the topic of racism but is not racist itself"". Almost 'naturally', there will be cases of racists posting racist dreck that cannot be improved and posts that should just be deleted, on sight on this site.</p>

<p>There was a new (I think) 'borderline' case on main: <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/49045/what-is-the-most-advanced-scientific-basis-for-anti-russian-sentiment"">https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/49045/what-is-the-most-advanced-scientific-basis-for-anti-russian-sentiment</a> (In hope that it gets edited, the following will refer to revision 1 in the edit history of that currently deleted question)</p>

<p>Mod Mark did comment: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no scientific, rational, basis for racism. The statement that X ""are incorrigibly inferior and unable to improve."" is racist and cannot be supported by any scientific argument. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He wrote a sentence that is completely valid, now, and reflects the community consensus. However, this is probably not what this question was really about. Great minds like Aristotle, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kant</a> had <a href=""https://philpapers.org/rec/KANOTD-2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">some ideas now considered racist</a> and thought of that as scientifically valid (speculation/reasoning). Both philosophers would have a hard time lecturing <em>that</em> at face value at any university now. But as far as I understood it, the question on main is about a setting from 1920–1950.</p>

<p>In that timeframe some held the view that ""X 'are incorrigibly inferior and unable to improve.'"" Since most of now think of this as a racist statement and that it cannot be supported by any scientific argument, OP probably wants a character that sounds as if he <em>would</em> have scientific arguments that seemed to support his position.</p>

<p>The way I read the question, it was <em>about</em> historic racism. About how to incorporate a character (who is essentially a racist) as a <em>believable</em> character. That is different from portraying a racist theory within a novel and that that theory would be believable <em>now,</em> or that it could be used for that. (If that kind of promotion is indeed the intention of the example question then I am seriously in error about that example and the rest of this answer immediately does no longer apply to the example question any more as a whole. Please regard the following then and therefore as a general comment on the situation.)</p>

<p>That would mean that the character at least hints at by name to a once widespread idea/concept/theory from the racist realm. This might be a primitive parole, heard in a speech, read in a book or newspaper, then regurgitated by a character in a novel, who would then look racist <em>and</em> unintelligent to wel educated readers. But racism and dumbness are not perfectly proportionally correlated and they never were. Racism is more of a belief system than something to understand –– but also, like other belief systems, something intelligent people tend to somehow rationalise, however misguided.</p>

<p>We now know, or at least should know, that racism is inhumane <em>and</em> inherently stupid, from a scientific viewpoint. For a character to be believable as racist and not coming across as totally stupid a modern author might want to resort to that character adopting scientific concepts that were once used as reinforcing arguments for the basically unrelated but foundational outgrouping mechanism that is racism. These scientific concepts might now be completely outdated, disproven or laughed at or whatnot. They are not taught in that way in good schools any more. And that makes it difficult for a modern fiction writer to go beyond that what everyone should know now. </p>

<p>Mainly, I think that it this kind of context that was missing from the original question. Assuming best intentions from the OP I guess then further that a non-native speaker <em>did</em> write some parts down that at least look racist to an American, or if just taken at face value: parts that even <em>are</em> racist (guessing: without OP even realising it). Most readers thought: ""Aha, a racist needs better racism for rambling in the streets and on SE!"" But I hope it is still discoverable in the text of the deleted question that they should have read: ""Oh, what a valid but difficult idea and how horrible this is presented. It invites misunderstanding, let's improve it!"". The key is that the motivation should come out clearer and that the intent is really the absolute opposite of racism: not explaining (past) 'racism as good' (still) with 'science concepts', but explaining that even scientifically minded persons succumbed to the flaws of thinking, group dynamics and feeling at that time.</p>

<p>In this case, how should OP signal his intentions better? More careful wording, proper grammar and definitions for the intended meaning, resulting in a clear <em>distance</em> from what characters say and what might be read as what the posters holds as true or even some kind of ""a truth universally acknowledged"".</p>

<p>While being very glad that this din't go 'hot' (having all the hallmarks of a Q for that) I think the downvotes are quite extreme. The Q is not a good one in presentation now, that's a given. But aren't most readers just mislead for the intentions OP had with it (despite being discoverable in the text)? –– Anyway, as I think that this can be made good, I'd plea for a delay should deletion votes come in quickly.</p>

<p>To re-iterate: The way I read it: Promoting racism is <em>not the intention.</em> Intention is (well, I hope should be?) Fictional character (most probably not the hero (good guy) should be historically accurately, or believably, be painted as racist, and argue for his position without sounding too idiotic, unbelievable. A problem well educated writers might face easily!</p>

<p>I guess this is much more about historical racism, than intended as being promoting racism  itself, now. But the wording misleads most readers. In parts it actually is rebuilding racist ideas without connecting that back to the thoughts laid out above.<br>
To be clear: I may very well be in complete error about the intent and actual content as intended in the example question. This is no unconditional plea to get it undeleted. If I am wrong about the example it should stay deleted.</p>

<p>That kind of questions could be improved, they can be improved, they should be improved. Questions <em>about</em> racism are difficult, to say the least. But they should not be a total taboo. They are important. We do not want to promote racist content. We do not want to foster racist ideas. But one method to achieve that might be to have content that describes how racism appeared to have work<strong>ed</strong> and appears to work in the minds of those who held those views. </p>

  <p>Race <strong><em>is</em></strong> an unacceptable theoretical category as <strong><em>it has been vigorously excluded</em></strong> from the scholarly tradition.</p>

<p>The unappetising thing about our history is that race <em>was</em> an acceptable theoretical category for perceived or imagined differences between human groups and it has been vigorously excluded from the scholarly tradition only fairly recently, in some parts of the world.</p>

<p>In my personal opinion, just naming a group of people ––(example: skin colour varies, I see that, but what follows from that? Not much. Properly educated ""blacks"" can get a noble prize and properly miseducated ""whites"" can be so incredibly stubbornly stupid as to necessitate this post. Change the colours around to your liking if you have to.)–– in any way should be unproblematic, regardless of what that name is. But giving out <em>certain</em> names is considered bad etiquette (I agree, gruntling about the humanity) and even a kind of racism itself (no full agreement). The common ground for what I would even opt to enforce the etiquette reason here is that those names deemed unfit for conversation is that these tainted names are symbolic communications that are meant to or even <em>do carry</em> the deterministic, disrespectful and degrading value judgements that are racist.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""... as long as necessary to properly answer a question, but not one word longer""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I endorse his answer entirely.  However, I would add a few additional caveats that I think are important.</p>

<hr>

<p>Firstly, none of us are paid to research topics and write answers (apart from the lucky few who are apparently part of the <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3504/are-se-history-members-paid-to-provoke-rewrite-and-thwart-away-non-us-history-q"">government funded program to suppress non-western history</a><sup><strong>1</strong></sup>, obviously).  It can often take a lot longer to edit a draft into a good, short answer than it did to research the question and write that draft in the first place.  I'm reminded of a fellow student many years back who, when asked by a tutor why his essay was so long replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Because I didn't have time to write a short one!"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, if you are using the SE editor, you will be aware that it can often take multiple edits just to complete a satisfactory draft answer (especially if you are working on a mobile device using the SE app!).</p>

<p>At some point, you will probably decide that the answer is 'good enough', and that you have invested as much time as you wish, or are able to.  At that stage it is fine to move on and answer another question (or spend time on the job that you are actually paid to do, or even - if you must - spending some time with your family).  As Semaphore has already said, its all about balance.</p>

<hr>

<p>Secondly, we generally don't know exactly who the target audience for an answer is going to be.  This is important, since it will define what it means to 'properly answer a question'.  We may be able to write a short answer with just enough detail to satisfy the OP, but how helpful will that answer then be to others in the future?  This extract from an SE pro-forma explains makes the point explicit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Please note that once you post a question or answer to this site, <strong>those posts become part of the collective efforts of others who have also contributed to that content</strong>. Posts that are potentially useful to others should not be removed except under extraordinary circumstances.""</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>(my emphasis)</li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, I think this probably means that we should be trying to write answers suitable for an audience of high-school students - even if we know that the OP already has a PhD in History!  That means explaining things in a bit more detail, and that - in turn - means a longer answer.</p>

<hr>

<p>Finally, we should be aiming to engage with people.  Personally, I like to attempt to use a little humour where I can (<em>yes, this answer would have been shorter if I didn't, but would it have still made you smile?</em>).  We aren't writing for an academic journal with a prescribed style-guide.  Write in a way that feels right to you, and if that makes your answer a little longer, then so be it.  </p>

<p>At the end of the day, it is going to be <strong><em>your</em></strong> answer, so - providing that it actually answers the question, and otherwise complies with the site rules and guidelines - it should be something that <strong><em>you</em></strong> are happy with.  If others like it too, that is a bonus.</p>

<p>Our <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer"">help-centre provides the guideline</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Read the question carefully. What, specifically, is the question asking for? Make sure your answer provides that – or a viable alternative. The answer can be “don’t do that”, but it should also include “try this instead”. Any answer that gets the asker going in the right direction is helpful, but do try to mention any limitations, assumptions or simplifications in your answer. Brevity is acceptable, but fuller explanations are better.</p>

<p>This ""don't do that"" could in our case to be interpreted as ""if you understand the question to mean…"". That is one example of thinking outside the box or leaving the frame of reference. </p>

<p>Questions have to be framed by the original poster, and we demand of them to do that as narrowly as  they can to enable us to post specific answers.

<blockquote>
  <p>Framing in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(social_sciences)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this context</a> means limiting how people view a topic; challenging the frame means breaking out of those limits to look at the problem from a different perspective. Challenging the frame is usually appropriate when the asker has the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem"">XY problem</a> (when you have problem X, and identify potential solution Y, and ask for help implementing Y instead of just asking for help with X).<br>

  <p>The “frame” being challenged here is specifically the way the question was framed — the way they put it forward, the parameters they offered, the kinds of answers they're driving for.</p>
  
  <p>Frame challenges are risky; sometimes they're a good idea and sometimes you just cop a whole lot of downvotes. We advise you also answer the question at face value, though you may prefer not to do so (and sometimes, it's a very good idea to not do so).<br>

<p>The question poster is the only person who is qualified to decide which answer best resolve their problem - as indicated by their power to mark an answer accepted. It is thus not up to us to decide which reading of the question is valid (of course, this doesn't apply to ""answers"" that are seemingly completely tangential to the question - feel free to leave a comment requesting clarification or flag for moderation attention).</p>

<p>We should thus vote on the question based on its quality, and let the SE system handle the rest.</p>

<hr>

<p>More generally speaking, a question's word choice might not be optimal, but noneteless sufficiently conveys the meaning of the author for a definitive answer. Alternatively, the question might have made a wrong assumption, but demonstrating this answers the question. For example, Q: Why did Romans use groups of 8? A: They didn't.</p>

<p>Most of the examples given falls under this category. For such questions, it is sufficient to simply answer them.</p>

<p>The really thorny problem is for questions that are genuinely confusing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ideally, if a question is problematic, it should be edited. But this doesn't always happen and is even less likely if it already attracted answers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's far too late to deal with a confusing question after answers have already appeared. In these cases, therefore, pre-emptive action is needed - the question should be put on hold ASAP and fixed, and then reopened and answered.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is an extremely negative perception of the put on hold process. Questions put on hold are often abandoned, or treated like a punishment, instead of a temporary status of transition.</p>

The <a href=""https://www.ushmm.org/confront-antisemitism/holocaust-denial-and-distortion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum article on <em>&quot;Holocaust Denial and Distortion&quot;</em></a> provides a short answer and good starting point to differentiates between hardcore and softcore denialism and relativism.</p>
<p>There is a problem in an <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/48505/26786"">answer</a> on a very sensitive topic. The following points of the answer at least <em>can</em> be read in several ways, discussed below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q</strong> Priorities of trains to Nazi death camps?</p>
<p>Not a full answer (don't have the time or sources right now) but the
claim is massively oversimplified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That the claim is an oversimplification is the probable reason for the question. Not having sources or time for an answer that is nevertheless written, is a lame excuse. For, what, exactly?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, a lot of German rail resources went to supporting the
concentration camps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Support&quot; – what is this? Food, drink, clothes, medicine? Or people going 'up in smoke'?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But a lot of that wouldn't be of use to the armed forces anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;that&quot; is &quot;support&quot;? Well, yeah, on the other hand starving holocaust victims are of no use at the front?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not only are the railway lines in Russia of a different
gauge from those in the Reich (and indeed most of Europe) so the trains wouldn't even fit on them,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Irrelevant. Victims were transported from most of Europe in the camps located mostly in Poland and Belarus. Further, when the Wehrmacht invaded, tracks were usually quickly converted. –– Does this say that in the East the transports were technically infeasible?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the lines can only support so many trains of such length passing over them in a given period, trying to put more trains on them wouldn't work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assertion without base, as this increase in length, packing density, frequency etc is exactly what happened. Or otherwise: &quot;increase wouldn't work&quot; from what baseline?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same problem plagues railroads all the time. E.g. the modern Dutch
rail system is massively congested. There are constant calls to run
more trains on it to meet the increased demand for passenger and cargo
capacity, but there simply isn't enough rail to go around, without
compromising safety by allowing multiple trains on each section of
track they can't increase capacity any further.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmhm. Railroad is awful in general; these days? –– &quot;Safety&quot; <em>was</em> compromised, and in case of cattle-boxcars not a requirement in the first place. Again a quibble about general considerations, 'common sense' that did not apply in that situation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And with the German army in retreat through Russia and Poland, laying
more track for them was out of the question. They had neither the
resources (steel, manpower) nor the time to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Until mid-1944 new tracks were laid down frequently, as needed. In Birkenau a new track was installed ending directly at the ramp. The above paragraph denies reality with a general thought that doesn't fit the evidence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Combine that with the ever increasing allied air attacks on railheads
and the trains themselves destroying a lot of the rolling stock in the
west (especially after D-Day) and not only do the Germans lack the
amount of rolling stock they need to fully support the troops in the
east, they also lack the capability of getting that rolling stock to
the railheads to load and later offload it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allied attacks after D-day were quite ineffective until the end of 1944. But apart from that, this is again tangential to answering the question. This is the very core of the question: war effort got ever more difficult during losing the war, so why and how did they continue to transport holocaust victims? In essence this just repeats the question with an ever more 'skeptical' undertone. It is unclear into what direction the skepticism is directed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And yes, the SS placed ever greater demands on German infrastructure
to support their operation of the camps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;SS&quot; <em>might</em> be a shift in agency away from willing executioners, located in Reichsbahn, industry etc. But:
&quot;Operation&quot; in reality meant killing. Is this the same meaning here?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not so much to &quot;transport Jews to the gas chambers&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the meaning <em>is a different one?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>but because those camps supplied the slave
labour needed by German industry to produce the weapons and other
equipment that was needed by the troops at the front.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is incompatible with reality. On average <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=25vSjtlq734C&amp;pg=PA246&amp;lpg=PA246"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">80% of new arrivals in Birkenau were immediately gassed</a>. It is true that a lot of slave labour went into armament as well, but the way it is depicted above is highly misleading. What was produced in Treblinka? Pure death.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As these inmates died after faster from ever declining living conditions and ever increased physical demands on their labour, they needed to be replaced ever faster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is more than contentious. As already stated, camps like Birkenau and Treblinka had absolutely no use for any other 'raw material' than victims to produce nothing else but death.</p>
<p>This is so much into the relativist and denialist camp: &quot;victims died because of 'conditions' (&quot;no death by gas chambers&quot;)&quot;.</p>
<p>It is intolerable. Yes, from those who were not killed instantly, many died while they waited for their turn to the gas chambers, monooxide vans etc of typhus and whatnot, and therefore 'for other reasons'. But the main point is that they were all designated to be exterminated, whether by hunger, labour, sickness, firing squad, experiments or death march or gas chamber. Emphasising the 'conditions' shifts the blame from intention to circumstance. This is absolutely intolerable.</p>
<p>And not more important in general, but technically for an SE site: does this answer the question or at least contributes to answering it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AND the camps needed ever increasing supplies of food for
those inmates, the failure of which to arrive played no small part in
the high death toll in the camps later in the war.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again the same melody. There wasn't even <a href=""https://www.theholocaustexplained.org/the-camps/daily-life/meals/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">any much food</a> planned or scheduled to arrive for <a href=""http://auschwitz.net/en/auschwitz-diet/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">all those</a> intended to be killed anyway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that while there were a few camps specialising in mass
killing of people, these were few (only 4 of them known to have
existed I think) and by the time your stated problem played were no
longer in operation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the second time the word &quot;play&quot; is used when talking about the holocaust.<br />
Further: Wrong number, wrong conceptualisation. At least 8 camps were designated or designed for instant death, the rest for intermediately fast death through other means. For the time of operation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(they were shut down by late 1943</p>
</blockquote>
<p>maybe a typo, but just in a few days we have <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Holocaust_Remembrance_Day"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Holocaust Remembrance Day.</a> Chosen as the date commemorating the liberation of Auschwitz by the Red Army. On 27 January 1945. Camps were kept in operation until the Soviets approached. For those furthest East that meant an earlier date.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>as it was realised that their operation was a waste of resources that could be used more effectively elsewhere, including sending the inmates to
other camps for hard labour in stone quaries, mines, and factories).</p>

This is <em>not</em> saying that the whole answer is holocaust denialism. That may be the case or not.</p>
<p>My good will likes to assume the better alternatives. The author was <em>perhaps</em> well meaning. The phrases and statements used were <em>perhaps</em> just too ambiguous with a misleading result, but not the intention. Sometimes answers written off-hand from memory rely on false memories or have mixups in them. Nevertheless, it seems the subtle <em>effects</em> are quite insidious.</p>
<p><em>This is saying</em> that such an answer is very poorly written, not well researched, not backed up with any references and stating things as fact that are not. This is saying that such a topic needs all the backup it can get. This is saying all those sentences that border on, touch tropes and topics of, or would qualify as denialism need deletion. This is saying that all those errors and imprecisions need edits and backup.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, what happens if one tries to paraphrase and summarise the salient points of that answer? What is left? Is that a desired result?</p>
<p>Requests for corrections were issued in comments and banners. The edits and corrections didn't come, despite the user being active on main.</p>
<p><strong>This is saying</strong> that I do not understand this community!</p>
<p>On a first reading one might not find much to criticise. But with that paucity of references or sources I wonder about the upvotes anyway, which were three or four in total before the criticism came. This is reason for concern.<br />
But after a closer reading this positive voting attitude should change. And after some of the problems were pointed out in comments, on the one hand the author didn't edit, but on the other hand at least one member in the community upvoted this answer, again!</p>

Practically all of our questions have something to do with wars, plagues, and other natural and unnatural shocks that flesh is heir to.

  <p>The Sonderzüge, contrary to myth, were given low priority for movement. The special trains were put into unoccupied slots intended for through freight trains or were run as freight extras.

<p>The above is the answer to the question if the OP isn't going to <strong>define <em>significant</em> or <em>military</em></strong>. And it's a Wiki link (at least I think - why is there an entire page worth of attribution?).</p>

<p>However horrible it was, the part of WWII known as the holocaust was <em>mostly</em> about genocide.

<p>History:SE is a community moderated site. In fact, Stack Exchange itself is <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/05/18/a-theory-of-moderation/"">designed to to be mostly self-regulating</a>.  To that end, as users gain reputation they also gain moderation privileges. So,</p>

<hr>

<p>In the general case, <strong>if a question or answer is clearly Holocaust denial, then it should be flagged, and Moderators can deal with it under the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/conduct"">Stack Exchange Code of Conduct</strong></a>.</p>

<p>In cases where it is less clear, then it should be for the community to act.  In my opinion, the answer you've quoted falls into this category.</p>

<hr>

<p>If no sources to support assertions have been provided, the first step - <em>again in my opinion</em> - should be to flag the post to allow a moderator to add a post notice.  This allows the OP an opportunity to deal with any problems that may have been highlighted in the comments, and to add links to sources supporting their assertions.</p>

<p>Downvoting is also a form of community moderation.  An answer should be downvoted when it is '<em>not useful</em>',as per the tooltip:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xvhof.png"" alt=""downvote tooltip""></p>

<p>If you consider that the answer isn't useful, because it lacks sources, or because it is factually inaccurate, or for any other reason, then please exercise your right to downvote.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, if the post-notice has been added, the community has exercised its right to downvote, and the OP has not improved their answer, then the last of the privileges I listed above comes into play: <em>the right to cast delete votes on negatively voted answers</em>.</p>

<p>Since moderators have a 'super-vote', we can't generally participate here - except as the last vote.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now in the case of this particular answer, for the most part I see legitimate dissent, although the lack of cited sources to support assertions always concerns me.  However, <em>in my opinion</em>, the part where the OP states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remember that while there were a few camps specialising in mass killing of people, these were few (only 4 of them known to have existed I think) and by the time your stated problem played were no longer in operation (they were shut down by late 1943 ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>crosses a line.</p>

<p>In fact, you also pointed out the problem with that section in your comment to the answer.  </p>

<p>If I weren't a Moderator, that passage, and the lack of cited sources means I would probably have voted to delete the question since the OP has chosen not to respond to the comments or the post-notice.  </p>

<p>But I am a Moderator, and - <em>in my opinion</em> - I should try not to impose my opinions on the site if I can avoid it.  I would rather hold back in the hope the community will step up.  </p>

<p><em>In my opinion</em>, situations like this should be dealt with by the community.  <strong>That means that high-rep users should exercise their right to vote to delete</strong>.</p>

<p>Of course, the community may feel differently.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, of course the SE reputation model can be a disincentive when it comes to deleting problematic posts.  In this case, the answer has a net score of -5.  </p>

<p>That is 5 upvotes (gaining the OP 50 rep) and 10 downvotes (costing the OP 20 rep).  </p>

<p>I understand that if reputation is a motivating factor then people may not want to delete a post that is worth +30 reputation, no matter how bad the rest of the community may consider it to be.</p>

<p>Again, <em>in my opinion</em>, this is where high-rep members of the community need to be proactive and vote to delete.</p>

<p>I've got two sources of discomfort, and I'll admit that I'm struggling to articulate them clearly, so I'm open to feedback.  </p>

<p>First, American chattel slavery dehumanizes a person. It transforms a person into a thing.  Once you've done that, it doesn't matter if you treat the resulting thing kindly.  It simply isn't possible to treat a possession with dignity.  The legal, cultural and psychological structures that create and maintain chattel slavery begin with the assumption that the slave has not only no dignity, but no right to dignity, any more than a comb or a saddle has a right to dignity.  Slaves had no right to respect, other than the sense in which I ""respect"" a saddle by not misusing it as a doorstop or leaving it outside in the snow.  This is the fundamental evil of slavery - the only rights the slave possessed were in the context of their ability to serve their master's will.  The slave knew that the master had the ability/right to torture, kill, sell, the slave at any time. Every day you weren't sold away from your family, whipped, or starved was a day when the master was ""kind"".  It is difficult for me as a modern person with a modern notion of civil rights to understand just how cruel that system is.  The only tool that I've found that helps me to imagine that relationship is the discussions I've had with some of my friends who have been in abusive relationships - it is fairly clear that once the abuser imposes the framework that the abuse is legitimate, that ""kindness"" is not uncommon.  But the abused is <em>obligated</em> to be kind, while the abuser has the perogative to be kind. The abuser has the option of granting the semblance of dignity, while the abused must be constantly aware of the fact that their fate depends on maintaining the abuser's dignity, happiness and wellness.  I'm uncomfortable with the question's focus on the semblance of dignity while ignoring the underlying social/legal structures that stripped the slave of all rights.</p>

<p>I'll ahve to leave the second source of discomfort for later when I have more time.</p>

<p>So seven voters found the question not only ""not good"" but really ""bad""; then 3 liked it. Before you brought this up here, I hadn't seen this question. But the question is as much a head scratcher to me as is the voting on it.</p>

<p>As sometimes quite some votes are very spuriously motivated, lets assume that in this case they all were from well-meaning users, properly rested and adequately caffeinated and nicotinised and up-sugared to <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/618/why-did-my-question-get-a-downvote"">vote fairly after analysi</a>s.</p>

<p>As far as voting on questions goes, I wouldn't and still haven't voted on this, simply because I think it's as it stands just mediocre, off-hand question. Anyone might have such a question, and even post it here, but it can and should be improved. In this case I'd say it doesn't deserve my upvote and I can almost see why people would want to downvote it.</p>

<p>That means first, it seems to lack documenting the OP's prior research into this. That is the biggest complaint I have with it. As a question. </p>

<p>Although I see <em>a lot</em> of other problems associated with this question as well. Such as ""well"", the word, in the title, without quotes, as used in this answer of mine. It is entirely unclear to me what the aim of this question really is. Mainly because the terms used are left undefined and invite misinterpretation, or even scolding the poster for using them.</p>

<p>What does ""well"" mean in this context? Is that term useful for describing something that we now find to be a contradiction in terms? </p>

<ul>
<li>If ""well"" can only mean to us that a slave owner freed his slave, then there would be examples to list. </li>
<li>If ""well"" means treatment measured on a scale that orients itself on modern ""human rights"", then there would be examples to list ranging from let's say -100 to -1, as we now define slavery as grossly incompatible with human rights. </li>
<li>If ""well"" means not ""good"" but just ""better than"" a neighbour to the South (or whatever direction), then there would be examples to list</li>
<li>If ""well"" means ""look, it wasn't all bad"", then we have a problem. Big time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The meaning and perspective are left unclear. This applies to all other qualifiers as well: ""dignity"", ""respect"", ""proper"", ""hearty"", etc. </p>

<p>Is this about applying modern views to a historical situation? Is this an inquiry into comparison of contemporary accounts? We do not know whether this is searching for diachronic or synchronic analysis and evaluation or for an anachronistic justification. Is this about how we judge these conditions and behaviours, how 'they' did it, or 'they' saw it and justified it? Addressing these complaints might be on a range from not easy to uneasy, but that should be edited into the question to avoid confusion. If not that still can be sorted out in answers.</p>

<p>However, the last bullet on that non-exhaustive list might be quite heavily frowned upon as being an attempt of pushing a disgusting narrative. It is unclear to me that the question would fall into that category ""to be closed as pushy"".</p>

<p>Some comments below the question try to address logical or historical short-comings of the question, but the usual problem with many comments crop up as well: almost half-answers, a pyramids joke… </p>

<p>So, logically 'was there anytime anything was above average' is always answered with: 'yes' by the very definition of 'average' (depending on which definition, we shouldn't jump to 50% in every case, but <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Wobegon#The_Lake_Wobegon_effect"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">you get the idea</a>).</p>

<p>This brings us to how to possibly answer this question:</p>

<p>For all four bullet points left unclear in the question these aspects would need to be addressed in an answer. Making these long, perhaps too long for the taste of most people here. </p>

<p>Then we have the undefined timescape, the undefined places. ""Americans"" and their ""slaves""? Not tracking an evolution and development over centuries but apparently assuming an answer of average paragraph length, summing it up as ""that was that"", at least implicitly conveying a uniformity in time and space. A tool of a quality a bit too blunt for my taste. And quite certainly really unfitting.</p>

  <p><strong>Q</strong> It seems like an objective, if not to difficult answer, question.</p>

<p>To me, it seems like a badly researched and badly presented question, that has serious shortcomings in objectivity. prior historical knowledge or research, and even logic. Answering that I would require from myself an amount of differential interpretation, <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3862/26786"">frame challenging</a> plus actually answering all the aspects I think in need of addressing: that this is a question that's extraordinarily difficult to answer properly.

<p>First off, some site culture: We get a lot of questions here that were posted not from a pure historical interest (assuming such a thing exists), but rather with an agenda. Most of these are questions relating to the Holocaust, and after repeatedly getting our fingers burned giving those questions the benefit of the doubt, we've learned to have higher standards for Holocaust/Nazi questions.</p>

<p>However, those aren't the only questions where that happens, of course. We get Turks asking questions goading us into saying the Armenian Genocide didn't happen. We get Indian nationalists goading us into saying all kinds of accepted stuff that goes against their dogma isn't true. We get people from about every country on Earth with an internet connection trying to goad us into saying there's been some kind of conspiracy to keep their particular country down.</p>

<p>And yes, occasionally we get US-based racists trying to goad us into affirming their racist beliefs about black people.</p>

<p>Now with that as a background, this is a question that looks an awful lot like its fishing for answers saying that slavery wasn't so bad, and that black people were perhaps arguably better off under it in some circumstances. This is an argument with <a href=""http://www.ushistory.org/us/27f.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a long racist history</a> in the US going back even before the Civil War.</p>

<p>Now I can see where a person ignorant of this history might hear the argument today, and innocently wonder about it. I can also see its obvious attraction to my fellow white people, as it absolves a certain amount of guilt. So I did feel it was worth refuting.</p>

<p>However, its also an argument you are almost certain to hear from a US-based White Supremicist, so I can also totally understand those who felt like downvoting the question with impunity, and going on with their day.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>2702 days in beta</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>5.4 questions per day</strong><br>
  Okay – 10 questions per day on average is a healthy beta, 5 questions or fewer per day needs some work. A healthy site generates lots of good content to make sure users keep coming back.</p>
  
  <p><strong>93% answered</strong><br>
  Excellent – 90% answered is a healthy beta, 80% answered needs some work. In the beta it's especially important that when new visitors ask questions they usually get a good answer.</p>
  
  <p><strong>1,371 avid users<br>
  24,724 total users</strong><br>
  Excellent – Every site needs a solid group of core users to assist in moderating the site. We recommend:<br>
  150 users with 200+ rep (currently 1,371 users with 200+ rep)<br>
  10 users with 2,000+ rep (currently 148 users with 2,000+ rep)<br>
  5 users with 3,000+ rep (currently 99 users with 3,000+ rep)  </p>
  
  <p><strong>2.1 answer ratio</strong><br>
  Okay – 2.5 answers per question is good, only 1 answer per question needs some work. On a healthy site, questions receive multiple answers and the best answer is voted to the top.</p>
  
  <p><strong>16,561 visits/day</strong>
  Excellent – 1,500 visits per day is good, 500 visits per day needs some work. A great site benefits people outside the community. Eventually, 90% of a site's traffic should come from search engines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above means that we would need more questions per day. The most important of the numbers above, and alas, our weak spot in the statistic. But then, that is among the criteria on the way out – apparently – to consider for graduation.</p>

<p>There seem to be <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/322781/writing-se-clamours-for-graduation/322783#322783"">changes for the procedure underway</a> and under the hood and undisclosed as of now. From what I gather: the whole graduation thing will be granularised? Meaning that post-graduation fetures will be addable to a site piece by piece as needed?</p>

<p>But these numbers alone aren't too reliable to predict a site's future, as <a href=""https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/6243/startup-business"">StartupBusinessSE</a> illustrates. </p>

<p>There are other problems to consider: the danger of being shut down because ""graduation doesn't happen"" isn't important anymore. <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/598/2018/2/16"">Too many 'broken windows' on a site is!</a>.</p>

<p>Positive signs <em>for</em> this site: community moderation is relatively reliable and reasonably quick, in my impression at least. Review queues are emptied quickly, SPAM and trolling often disappears faster than the feed subscription can post it to chat, moderators seem to be doing their job and participate regularly as users as well, with very low indication of mod-fatigue or user complaints (again: my personal impression).</p>

<p>Something not surveyed on Area51 but important indicator for site health would be participation on Meta.History.SE, i.e. <em>here.</em> That is subpar, by quite the margin. Question re-open rate is also on the list of 'improvable'.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the <em>currently</em> still valid official word would be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257614/graduation-site-closure-and-a-clearer-outlook-on-the-health-of-se-sites"">Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites:</a> 
  The TL;DR:</p>
  
  <p>When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation.<br>
  <strong>If a public beta site does not produce consistently helpful content, and lacks the caretakers needed for flags and spam to get handled and our Be Nice policy to be upheld, it will be closed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>To get nearer to the ""How to graduate this site"", we clearly need more questions per day. And that is more <em>good</em> questions, I might add.</p>

<p>More participation on meta would be nice.</p>

<p>But then, I currently see no real need to really push for it. The WritingSE example indicates a certain level of arbitriness on the one hand and possibly less need overall on the other.</p>

<p>The threat of closure seems far from being a danger for this site.</p>

<p>It seems the other way around compared to what the question assumes: graduation doesn't assure quality, but we have to strive for more content and more quality before we can be considered for graduation.</p>

<p>Exactly. Comparatively observing, though it is in my opinion too, this site is rather more ""peaceful"" than the other sites ( especially like ELL or ELUs ), and I am happy with that.</p>

<p>Now onto your summary.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That would be the most agonizing question every sites would like to solve, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>From what I observed, History SE has a bit 2 sided, there are either good questions or bad questions, comparatively no middle size questions, though, again in my personal opinion.</p>

<p>So, in order for us to ""graduate"" Beta, may be the fastest way is for the Meta SE to change the current graduation standard?</p>

<p>Hmmm....</p>

<p>Thank you again anyway for your answer.</p>

<p>Some questions tagged with it are definitely not of that global-history scope. Reproducing the Wikipedia def:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>World history or Global history (not to be confused with diplomatic, transnational or international history) is a field of historical study that emerged as a distinct academic field in the 1980s. It examines history from a global perspective. It is not to be confused with comparative history, which, like world history, deals with the history of multiple cultures and nations, but does not do so on a global scale. <strong>World history looks for common patterns that emerge across all cultures.</strong> World historians use a thematic approach, with two major focal points: integration (how processes of world history have drawn people of the world together) and difference (how patterns of world history reveal the diversity of the human experiences).</p>

<h2>Top 100 Users by Bounties Received</h2>

<p>The question <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/221642/unidentified-best-bounty-hunter"">Unidentified best bounty hunter?</a> on Meta:SE includes a query that I copied and ran on History:SE:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Top 100
  Posts.OwnerUserId As [User Link], COUNT(*) As BountiesWon
FROM Votes
  INNER JOIN Posts ON Votes.PostId = Posts.Id
WHERE
  VoteTypeId=9
GROUP BY
  Posts.OwnerUserId
ORDER BY
  BountiesWon DESC

<p>This got the following results for an ""<em>All-time Bounties Leaderboard</em>"":</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UZ7aB.png"" alt=""Total bounties received by users""></p>

<hr>

<p>Restricting the date may be a little more tricky.  I think I can restrict by the post creation date using something like:</p>

<pre><code>WHERE
    votetypeid = 9 and creationdate between 'mm/dd/yyyy' AND 'mm/dd/yyyy'
</code></pre>

<p>(<strong>remembering to use the US date format</strong>), but, of course, a bounty could be awarded long after the actual post was created.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Top 100 Users by Bounties Offered</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z4XN0.png"" alt=""Users by bounties offered""></p>

<hr>

<p>I added a line to restrict the search to a particular date range (in this case I set it to be 1 January 2018 - 31 December 2018):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT TOP(100)
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(Votes.BountyAmount) DESC, Users.ID) AS rnSum
  ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC, Users.ID) AS rnCount
  ,Users.ID
  ,Users.DisplayName
  ,Users.Reputation
  ,SUM(Votes.BountyAmount) AS BountyOfferedTotal
  ,COUNT(*) AS BountyOfferedCount

  INNER JOIN Posts ON Posts.ID = Votes.PostID

<p>One problem that many are not aware of is the behaviour of the re-open queue.</p>

<p>There is an inherent SE-design problem with our desire to edit posts into shape and our behaviour in trying to ensure this with fast and numerous small friendly edits.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Please do not edit questions that have recently been put ""on hold""<br>
—— with minor edits that do not attempt to address the ""on hold"" reason as well.</strong> </p>

<p>In other words: ""If its recently been put on hold, only edit to attempt to alleviate the problems that got it put on hold"".</p>

<p>If you do edit <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/196074/lots-of-questions-in-the-reopen-queue/196078#196078"">within the first five days</a> it will enter automatically the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/161390/what-are-the-review-queues-and-how-do-they-work/161391#161391"">""re-open"" of the review queue.</a></p>

<p>If your edit is simply a correction of grammatical errors or a correction of the question's markup, <em>without addressing the real reason for the ""on hold"" of the question,</em> then this is the case:</p>

<ul>
<li>the question will very likely not be reopened from review</li>
<li>when the original author fixes whatever the actual issue is with the question, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/237214/can-multiple-edits-send-an-on-hold-question-to-reopen-queue-more-than-once/239443#239443"">it will not be put back into the review queue</a></li>
<li>as a consequence, the user will be denied the opportunity to have their question automatically pushed into the reopen review queue.</li>
</ul>

<p>When a question is put on hold, it is not necessary to change it, especially not just to delete a few lines of ""Thank you"" or ""I am a Noob"", or to correct the markup or spelling (unless it helped to put the question on hold, which would be sad). </p>

<p>All the above does not apply for really fast edits — <em>before</em> it gets ""on hold"" status. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>If you think you can really improve the status of the question so that it is worth reopening, edit it in any case and then vote for reopening.</strong></p>

<p>If you are editing messages, and <em>especially</em> if you are editing questions that have been closed within the last five days (and <em>doubly especially</em> if you are &lt;2K rep (or 1K, since we're still beta) and submit an edit suggestion),<br>
<em>try to identify all the things in the message that should (can) be improved and change them all into one edition.</em>  </p>

<p>Don't do a little editing, then another one, then another one, then another one.  If you need to make many changes and are afraid of losing your Internet connection, <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3636/does-anyone-use-any-offline-tools-to-help-compose-their-answers/3642#3642"">work in an editor on your system</a> and copy them to Stack Exchange when you are ready to do it all in one go.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>As explained above, even a small modification of a recently closed question will move it to the reopening queue.  If you make only a small change, the question will probably not reopen, so you have wasted the ""free"" criticism.</p></li>
<li><p>When you submit suggested changes, you work for the reviewers in the suggested queue.  Please do not increase the workload for these reviewers.<br>
And, if you make a lot of changes to the same message, it seems that you are trying to milk the system for its reputation (i.e. get the +2 several times).</p></li>
<li><p>Many small changes clutter the revision history and constantly bump the post to the top of the homepage or active questions tab.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, a little redundancy:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Edit first, <em>then</em> vote-to-close (if it's still open but about to be closed))</p></li>
<li><p>Wait five days, at least, for minor edits:<br>
Minor edits that do not address mainly the closure reason, like tagging, spelling fixes etc, should wait a little more than five days</p></li>
<li><p><em>Edits that do address the close reason after five days should be accompanied with a re-open vote!</em> </p></li>
<li><p>Try to always edit <em>everything</em> you can to improve the post in one session.</p></li>

<p>Yes, it's a bad question, and, no, we're not here to do people's homework for them. <strong>But</strong> the sheer naivete suggests the OP is very young and drove me, (rightly or wrongly) to do a quick Google and suggest a few starting points. It is, after all, not a particularly easy question to research. </p>

<p>But the question was almost immediately - and understandably - put on hold, and by some of the leading contributors, whose depth and breadth of expertise overawe me. <strong>However</strong> I do have some concerns that instantly shutting down such questions from embryonic historians could be counter-productive in the long term. We want to encourage historical enquiry, don't we?</p>

<p>I am quite sure I have asked stupid questions, and given stupid answers, on occasions, but people have been kind enough not to say so! </p>

<p>Should we not give younger members a little more leeway? Discuss ;-) </p>

<p>A while ago I complained about a perceived discrepancy between <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3783/consistency-of-quality-standards-and-hot-network-questions"">Consistency of quality standards and Hot Network Questions</a> and in light of the changes to SE algorithm <em>and</em> mod powers, it seems an updated discussion might be worth it.</p>

<p>From the HNQ questions I listed above I am still unsatisfied with the quality of these questions as they appear on the network list. Not always, but sometimes, and to me that means 'too often'.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How do they get on the HNQ-list?</p>

<p>We put them there.<br>
By many quick views, quick upvotes and quick answers.
Quick is only rarely congruent with quality, as explained in the linked post.</p></li>
<li><p>How do they get off of the list?</p>

<p>By negative voting, putting on hold, removal by moderator.<br>
If fixed quickly, post-on-hold questions (re-opened) can re-enter. Mod-removed questions can not. Controversial voting seems to favour HNQ as long as the resulting number is positive.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The biggest problems of poor questions making the list are </p>

<ul>
<li>the representation of this site towards the network (rarely with: ""good question!""), </li>
<li>voting windfalls for substandard questions (thwarting part of <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/whats-reputation"">'our model'</a>), </li>
<li>attracting even more comments and answers of questionable quality,</li>
<li>blocking good questions from entering the list (including the vote pattern distortion introduced by HNQ voting effects) </li>
</ul>

<p>As my personal opinion on question quality alone doesn't count for much, I'd like to discuss a couple of things here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Should we remind people that upvoting poor or substandard questions is 'not a good thing™'?</li>
<li>Should we encourage moderators to remove a few questions that do not meet agreed upon standards and formulate a policy framework for that?</li>
<li>Should we do nothing and just watch, and be content with what the HNQ-algo does, and what all votes from all over the network accomplish?</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/53146/26786"">What publication claimed that Michael Jackson died in a nuclear holocaust?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And as another empirical data-point, a post that was mod-removed and was
then discussed on meta, with a mod stating some reasons for the decision:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In my experience, the questions that get put on hold instantly are ones where it's clearly a homework question that is ""pasted"" directly (e.g. ""Give three reasons why...""). In these cases, the OP is hoping for an answer that they can cut-n-paste directly into their homework. So we aren't dealing with an embryonic historian, we're dealing with someone that's trying to avoid learning history altogether.</p>

<p>The whole point of this type of homework is teaching children how to research and evaluate the information that they find. It's developing those skills (rather than the knowledge that the answers might (or might not) contain) that are important. If we indulge them with bypassing that learning process then we're doing them a disservice.</p>

<p>Also putting an question on hold doesn't prevent them from being edited into better (more appropriate) questions. The 'on hold' status merely stops answers being made before the question is properly formed.  </p>

<p>To be honest, I think (hope?) that most of us would find sexism just as offensive as racism, even if it wasn't explicitly forbidden by the Code of Conduct.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>In general, if you see content that breaches the SE Code of Conduct, please flag it for moderator attention.</strong>  </p>

<p>However, personally I also generally try to assume good intentions (as suggested by the previous SE Code of Conduct, although this can sometimes be really hard).</p>

<p>In a case where it may simply be a poorly-chosen word, I would probably initially suggest an edit to the question.  It is possible that word might have been suggested by some content elsewhere which is what motivated the person to ask the question.  Alternatively, the question may simply have been posted by someone for whom English is not their first language.</p>

<p>If that suggested edit was rejected, it would rather suggest that the choice of word was deliberate, and I would then flag the question for moderator attention.</p>

<hr>

<p>In this particular case, I believe that offensive comments were flagged and have now been removed.  The question has also now been edited.</p>

<p>Point 1:
Our moderation system heavily depends on users. If you see something, flag something. If its a post over which you have edit privs, fix it yourself.</p>

<p>Point 2: 
Point 1 above, in the case of sexism is directed at everyone here <strong>except Rose</strong>. As one of our (sadly) very very few regular posters with an unambiguously female user profile, it should not be <em>her</em> job to police this site for gender offensive material. We have a few Jewish regulars here too, and they likely are occasionally among those flagging Nazi material when it pops up. However, Rose is absolutely right that we don't expect them to handle all the Nazis all by themselves for us, or to educate us about why specific things are offensive.</p>

<p>The genius of the SE mod system is that it can identify and remove offensive material in many cases <em>even before it hurts anyone</em>, robbing the troll of that thrill they get from being offensive. It can do this because, while the trolls always outnumber the moderators, the non troll users outnumber the trolls. So its incumbent on the rest of us to love our community enough to get bigoted material removed before it does much damage.</p>

<li>Is it useful to have a separate tag for rulers with ""Ceasar"" in their name/title?</li>

<p>I could see arguments on both sides of this. People used it that way 4 times (despite the tag wiki). Perhaps it might even be worthwhile to have something that somehow includes later titles derived from ""Ceasar"" (eg: Tsar, Keiser). However, I think I'm currently leaning toward a ""no"" on this one. Perhaps if we need something like ""Emperor"", that can be discussed separately.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>closed Q has an (imo terrible) A. That can now not be 'corrected' with competing As anymore. Site dynamics predict that the terrible A will get way more UVs than DVs, distorting the SEmodel for quality. I'd thought about vote-ban on closed Qs &amp; their As (not implemented) or rigorous deletions (also problematic). </p>

<p>Should we have a cultural norm to avoid close votes on questions with (quality - at least one upvote) answers? </p>

<p>This should not result in a hard/fast rule; I'm suggesting a cultural norm - a recognition that if we see an answer that isn't heinous, we think twice before hitting the ""close"" button.  (hat tip to @T.E.D for clarity in the question).</p>

  <p>I've seen questions get an ""answer"" that's actually a detailed explanation of why the question is poor. The question gets closed but the answer still gets upvotes. This is fine with me, and I see no reason to avoid close votes in that case.</p>

<p>That's about what you can expect for a flagging in this situation. In theory of course, chat is supposed to have the exact same niceness standards as the rest of the site.

<p>I personally believe this is because its not as public, so egos aren't quite as involved. Also, there's a barrier to participation that casual readers aren't very likely to cross. Thirdly, the more interactive (and real-time) nature of the chat just makes everything said much more like a personal discussion, which seems to tamper down all but the worst actors.

<p>Personally, in this specific case, I'm not sure that the username is actually offensive.  For all we know, it may simply be an accurate description of that user's views.  In any case, it does give some advance warning of potential bias that might appear in questions or answers from that user, and perhaps might also highlight that we should be aware of the possibility of 'push questions' from that account.</p>

If I were to try to make a hard rule, I'd say the first half is out of bounds since its referring to a nationality, while the second isn't since its referring to political opinion. However, if I take into account the <em>history</em> of the words, the first half tends to be used in some rather benign circumstances, while the second has historically been used as a label to both promote and justify mass murder. So no matter which way I look at it, half of it is probably offensive. I can chose to interpret the whole thing as benign, but I have to do some mental gymnastics to do so. (I'm inclined to think this may have been by design)</p>

<p>I went and discussed this in the moderator chatroom, and was pointed to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/117596/possibly-offensive-usernames/117617#117617"">this post</a> as the canonical source for dealing with offensive user names.</p>

  <p>I believe that if you're asking and answering questions or leaving
  comments around with your name attached to it, then it is better (and
  I would go far as to say make it a policy) to not have any
  objectionable/vulgar content as your display name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a place for reasonably vulgar words used in a non-offensive,
  targetless manner. That's in your profile in the ""About me"" section.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The executive summary is that user names are special, as they are plastered over every post the user makes, and <strong>other users are forced to type those words</strong> to interact with your posts. For that reason, if <em>anyone</em> plausibly finds a username offensive, it should probably be flagged and reset. We are trying to be a welcoming community, and people should not be forced to type things that they consider slurs to participate.</p>

<p>If the user wants to baldly state that they are anti-Zionist and anti-American in their profile that's OK. If they want to put those exact words in a post, its debatable. But if someone flags that as offensive in a username, I'd feel compelled to reset the name.</p>

<p>(I probably missed a few others.)</p>

<p>At the moment who gets a tag seems a bit arbitrary. And it seems odd, judging by some cursory searches (Bismarck, Louis XVI, Galileo, etc.), that some first tier historical characters don't have a tag when they probably should.</p>

<p>Just for clarity, I'm of the opinion that such tags ought to be for questions that are <em>about</em> the individuals in question. I'm assuming there is consensus on this idea in the History SE community. I'm further assuming that this state is not by design (or is it?) and that there's consensus that having people tags that newcomers can pick from is desirable.</p>

<p>I suspect that there are two main reasons for our dearth of people tags. The first is that users with high enough reputation to create tags are less likely to ask questions. The other is that it's more natural to use existing tags than it is to create them when asking or editing questions. (Anecdotally, I seldom do so.)</p>

<p>Now, assuming this is not by design (and the comments on this question suggests it is not):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there agreement on History SE that we want more people related tags and encourage their use for applicable questions?</p></li>
<li><p>If so, which format should we be preferring? For instance I've just created <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/louis-xiv"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;louis-xiv&#39;"" rel=""tag"">louis-xiv</a>. This was a safe choice for the Sun King, but it could just as well have been <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/louis-xiv-france"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;louis-xiv-france&#39;"" rel=""tag"">louis-xiv-france</a> or something to the same effect, so that <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/charles-i-england"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;charles-i-england&#39;"" rel=""tag"">charles-i-england</a> is not confused with the many other Charles I.</p></li>

Call them tier-1 characters. If we've more than a few questions about them, then they probably deserve a tag for use by future newcomers who would like to ask about these people.</p>

<p>Which people do get a tag is something I think we can leave to the judgement of whoever opts to create them. Those who can create tags usually know enough about history to decide that Napoleon is obviously tier-1 and deserves a tag; that names that rise above the surface, such as Lafayette or Talleyrand, might deserve one too; and that a more obscure character, like Auguste de Marmont, is probably too localized to deserve one (however notorious he was in his days).</p>

<p>The format should be unequivocal, and we can use a simple Google search for guidance:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some names are unambiguous and make good tags as is. There is only one Hitler that matters. There is only one Napoleon proper; the other is Napoleon is always referred to as Napoleon III -- or Napoleon Le Petit, for the acquainted.</p></li>

The purpose of tags is to help with search; for the most part, we can just search for the name of the person. Questions about an individual will ipso facto mention them by name, reducing the utility of having a specific tag.</p>

<p><strong>However, in some cases, they can be very useful.</strong> The primary benefit of these tags is to filter out questions that just happen to mention an individual's name, but isn't actually asking about that person. Nonetheless, this isn't really much of a concern other than for a select few figures of outsized importance, most of whom do have their own tags.</p>

<p>Of course the root of the issue is that there's limited real estate for tags, so we should be somewhat judicious about what to turn into tags.

<p>The above raises a number of issues, some of which have been commented on extensively in other meta posts, but for now I'm just looking for clarification on my main question because at the moment I'm a little confused.</p>

<hr>

<p>You can absolutely flag answers that lack sources.  Those answers will then be reviewed by a moderator.  If appropriate, the moderator will then add the ""Citations required"" post notice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Some of the information contained in this post requires additional references. Please edit to add citations to reliable sources that support the assertions made here. Unsourced material may be disputed or deleted.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>However, sometimes the answer may actually include a rather vague 'citation', for example something along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""See memoirs and other literature from the period""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That answer would certainly lack specific sources, and would undoubtedly be improved by adding examples (if they exist), but it does complicate the question of whether it is really an 'unsupported assertion'.  In such situations I will review the flag on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>If the content of the answer is very contentious or controversial, then I would generally still add the post notice.</p>

<p>However, in less contentious cases, my preference would be to add a comment pointing out that the answer would be improved enormously by citing specific examples of those ""memoirs and other literature"", rather than just adding the generic post notice, which has frequently been claimed to be an <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/08/20/upcoming-on-stack-overflow/?cb=1"">unfriendly form of feedback</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Which then brings us to the question of how I would deal with the flag.</p>

<p>In most cases, I would probably mark the flag as ""helpful"", but I am also aware that the system maintains a record of 'bad' flags against accounts (I don't think it necessarily does anything with them other than keep count, but I am nevertheless aware that a record is kept).  </p>

<p>If I feel it is appropriate to add the post notice then the flag was clearly helpful, and will be marked as such. </p>

<p>In other cases, I will usually look at the context.  For example, had there been any other comments asking for clarification, requesting sources, or pointing out errors prior to the flag being raised, and had the OP been given a reasonable time in which to respond?</p>

<hr>

<p>Just as a side-note, I would argue that it is always important to allow people a reasonable time to respond to requests for improvement in comments (for both questions and answers) if we are to be seen to be treating them with ""fairness and impartiality"" (to quote the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/05/18/a-theory-of-moderation/"">Theory of Moderation</a>).</p>

<hr>

<p>So, to follow through on that example, if I feel that the issue had already been raised in comments, and that the OP hadn't had a reasonable time to respond, then I may decline the flag.  Simply put, at that point, <strong>the issue doesn't yet require moderator intervention</strong>.</p>

<p>But I will always try to deal with every flag on merit, and on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>Related to <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3944/can-we-flag-answers-because-they-lack-sources"">Can we flag answers because they lack sources?</a> I would argue that we might be better off as a site if we would add the citation needed banner (post-notice) more often. And remove it equally swiftly if these quality concerns are mitigated by edits.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Unless an answer uses quite simple but ingenious types of logic or other prolegomena, like ""No, you just <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_of_Columbus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">need to boil that egg…""</a> on a very fundamental level, history answers <em>need</em> supporting references from primary or secondary sources. If an answer seems to not be in need of supporting external evidence, I guess such an answer falls under what we write to close certain questions: ""it is too basic"" to be useful here.</p>

<p>That the current community consensus at least strongly supports a certain level of citations as a requirement I conclude from these meta posts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/99/our-answers-need-to-be-more-like-skeptic-ses-answers"">Our answers need to be more like skeptic.SE&#39;s answers</a> (32 upvotes):</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Every answer must have one or more references.</li>
  <li>Its references must support the argument, and should be verifiable.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3380/do-we-expect-answers-to-cite-sources"">Do we expect answers to cite sources?</a> (13 upvotes for question, <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3382/26786"">highest voted answer 17 in support of sources</a>) and a mod comment stating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just as an option for you to consider, you can flag a question for not containing sources and I will put the citations required post notice on it. So you don't necessarily have to post a comment if you are wary of the usual interactions that ensue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This need for citations is in my opinion quite direly needed as a general minimum yardstick for answer quality. But it gets even worse for cases were the SE model of voting fails egregiously. A lot of answers under tags of military, war, nazi, Germany, Soviet Union, Hitler, World War, attract a multitude of opinionated answers. Answers that lack sources in support of their argument. Answers that are just popular, and gather upvotes. Answer that are popular, and just wrong.</p>

<p>For these cases I suspect that the citation needed banner –– and possibly a following deletion, either regardless of upvotes, or especially <em>because of these upvotes!</em> –– should be helpful for the site health and reputation.</p>

<p>That banner works both ways: </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>as a stronger incentive than mere comments for the poster to improve the answer with an edit that adds supporting and verifiable or falsifiable external evidence</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>as a reminder for readers and potential voters that the post contains either <em>unsupported</em> controversial, probably wrong, or otherwise lacking information</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>For these quality reasons I suggest that answers lacking references </p>

<ol>
<li>should be commented on, addressing their shortcomings</li>
<li>should be downvoted, depending on level of perceived wrongness or cooperation by the poster either immediately or after the poster was given enough time to react to complaints</li>
<li><strong>should gather flags</strong>

<ul>
<li>should almost all get eligible for flagging, and </li>
<li>should be flagged for 'needs citations', and </li>
<li><strong>should be handled by moderators still on a case by case basis, but with a strong <em>positive preference towards adding</em> this removable post-notice</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Requesting references/sources/citations via a banner <em>may</em> be received as being unfriendly now. This might then need improvement in the text, as preliminarily discussed in <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3793/suggesting-improvements-to-the-citation-needed-label-or-post-notice"">Suggesting improvements to the &quot;Citation needed&quot; label or post notice</a> </p>

<p>But insisting on this quality standard to avoid upvotes on mere opinions is not 'unfriendly'. Waiting a while before flagging may be really polite, but shouldn't be a requirement. Even with the banner in place every poster still has chance and time to improve the posts with proper edits, adding references.</p>

<p>In chat (where I typically cannot find it anymore) as well in a comment below an answer for 
<a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3867/how-to-enforce-much-stronger-standards-for-answers-touching-nazi-holocaust-topic"">How to enforce much stronger standards for answers touching Nazi/Holocaust topics?</a> it was said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>flagging them I assume, <strong>but more importantly by putting a banner on the answer in dispute</strong> (that's as close to Skeptics as y'all got I guess … that's all I can offer you for help to understand this community, which is now all of SE thanks to the HNQ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Users and mods seem to have different opinions and existing practices for this in place, which seem to be according to personal preferences and not always entirely transparent. </p>

<p>Two aspects I know exist and might need addressing, but about which I lack the expertise to evaluate them properly: 
- flags raised against one account do accumulate as a negative record behind the scenes
- flags raised for the flagger are also recorded, counted and 'declined' flags might also have negative consequences (they certainly do 'not look good', and decrease motivation for further flagging)</p>

<p>So, I'd like to know the opinion on this or other options suggested from the current community:</p>

<ol>
<li>Should more banners be added to answers lacking references – that is: should we flag more and mods become more inclined to add banners after flags?</li>
<li>What should be aspects of proper procedure for both flaggers and mods reacting to them – mainly concerning content, timing, phrasing?</li>
</ol>

We need to strike a balance that includes both.  IMHO, the balance has to fall on the side of scholarship. I want to work in a SE where I can learn history without fear of abuse. I prefer that over a friendly discussion site with a history inclination. </p>

<p>Let me try to be more concrete.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Please flag rude/unkind/unfriendly messages. Be tolerant, because many of us (myself included) have failed to understand how something could be perceived as unkind.  But let us be zealous in flagging comments that create an environment that we don't want to grow in.</p></li>
<li><p>Be equally zealous about recognizing improvements.  Use flags &amp; comments to note when posts are changed in response to flags.  If there is a mod notice on a post that you think is no longer valid, post a comment that says, ""I believe that the mod notice is no longer valid; please flag <em>this</em> comment for moderator attention"".  (I don't believe you can flag a mod notice, nor can you flag your own post.  But curation is a team sport; you can ask that someone else apply the flag that will push the issue into the moderation queue)</p></li>
<li><p>Conditional comments, ""This is a good answer; if it had sources, I'd feel more comfortable upvoting.""</p></li>
<li><p>Phrase flags/mod messages/other feedback to emphasize what we want. We want this to be a place to learn.  Requests for references aren't merely a challenge to the statement - they are also an opportunity to learn. Many times I've spotted an assertion here on H:SE that sparked ideas and connections in my head, and the more references there are, the more likely I am to be able to follow that up while the sparks are still hot, to learn something new. That is a core part of why I use this site. </p></li>
<li><p>Be conscious of new users; if the user's rep is less than 200, then bend over to be welcoming.  Those with a rep of less than 200 cannot reasonably be expected to understand the culture towards which we strive.  (While I strongly support referring them to [help], I have to acknowledge that I don't believe [help] is as effective as it could be in communicating culture).</p></li>
<li><p>Be friendly; model the change you want to see.  Before I hit enter on a post, I try to pretend that the person I'm writing to has the power to do me harm.  Is what I've just written likely to cause them to kneejerk cause that harm?  (Note: I fail at his regularly, but I try).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Other concrete suggestions? </p>

<p>The real answer is going to be in the behavior of the users. We are a community curated site, and the outcome will be determined by how often people flag posts for references and how often people flag posts for unkindness.  The two aren't diametrically opposed; we can flag for both.  There will be false positives and false negatives, and there will be judgement calls. But the culture of H:SE will emerge from those activities.  I'm glad that @LangLangC asked the question, but the answer will have to emerge from community curation.</p>

<p>We want quality. Answers need quality, and without sources there is probably not much quality.</p>

<p>After all, <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3380/do-we-expect-answers-to-cite-sources"">Do we expect answers to cite sources?</a> Is answered with at least a ""tendency"" towards yes, and as T.E.D. noted in an answer there:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So just on the superficial objective level, I can tell you that good answers here tend to have linked references in them for non-trivial assertions, and bad ones tend not to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We neither need trivial assertions nor bad answers, but <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/99/our-answers-need-to-be-more-like-skeptic-ses-answers"">Our answers need to be more like skeptic.SE&#39;s answers</a> .</p>

<p>It follows that central facts, central points and central arguments should not be trivial – and from that alone: thus they need references as backup from external sources.</p>

<p>A site with a focus on 'history', on which historical topics are discussed that allows for a large portion of posts to come along <em>without</em> supporting references <em>is</em> a geeky 'discussion board' where mere opinions are exchanged, as nobody can check up properly what is being said without being in the loop. A reference-less post builds on trust, the whole trust and nothing but trust. That <em>may</em> work if the guru that posted such an answer is trustworthy <em>and</em> error-free.</p>

<p>In reality, that never works reliably all the time. </p>

<p>Yes, we want <em>new</em> users and not only because of that we want to be welcoming and friendly. And added to that we want quality posts and avoid driving away more professionally minded users. Those pros we need to come back as well. That in turn depends a lot on maintaining and increasing <em>quality not quantity</em> of posts.</p>

<p>One thing is sure: I have seen high-rep users posting cheesy stuff here. Which I most probably then criticised in comments. I am also sure that quite alot of people will have found one or more of my posts to be within that category. As a matter of conviction, I also suspect to have posted stuff here with the occasional genuine error in it, perhaps still remaining. And I am quite confident to enter arguments, or content disputes, with a healthy dose of ""look at the sources for yourself, here they are, I quoted a bit for convenience"".</p>

<p>Any post that does not cite is effectively hiding its sources, and it's excluding its readers from really learning anything. Any posts that does not cite its sources is either disingenuously trivial, or eliciting an immediate follow up question: <em>And how do</em> you <em>know?</em></p>

<p>– Sub-1: That is really the kicker here. 'RndGirl on HSE said X' is worthless in principle and insofar as that maybe a brilliant contribution, based on robust scholarship, argumentation and expertise. But RndGirl is perhaps just this little guy in a hut making up stories. Without external refs that are fairly easy to check/look for how others have evaluated them, it comes down to mere trusting that RndGuy doesn't just write a convincing sentence structure of the 'beauty is veracity' type, which we would have to deconstruct and research all over again from all the bits found therein.</p>

<p>– Sub-2: By ""central point"" it should be clear that in an answer stating ""Smith was in a secret cabal with Miller to do outrageous stuff"" we do not need Wikipedia links to Smith or Miller, if those pages do not prove the secret cabal. That is cargo cult citation, and those types of answers should be flagged following these criteria: everything, always, and immediately.</p>

<p>– Sub-3: Such a policy should shorten comment strings as well, as  we do not want to grow them too long, and serve as as notice</p>

<ul>
<li>to the poster, to improve</li>
<li>to the reader, to take appropriate doses of salt</li>
<li>to future posters, to start out alright, with sources, references, citations and quotes</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore I suggest we <em>should</em> flag more for ""citation needed"" banners. That we also <em>should</em> all try to get those banners then removed again: either with helpful comments; or direct edits, adding needed sources, deleting unsourced parts, or even deleting the entire post. </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>as a stronger incentive than mere comments for the poster to improve the answer with an edit that adds supporting and verifiable or falsifiable external evidence</strong></p></li>

<p>We need to find a balance between being ""inviting and friendly"" and maintaining and improving quality standards. Adding such a 'citation needed' banner should not be seen as unfriendly per se. It's how we handle them and the posts they apply to. Having policy that clearly states this stance and explains it well is preferable.</p>

<p>I agree that those with sufficient reputation should be more proactive about downvoting, flagging, and voting to close/delete problem posts.  This is a community moderated site, and I'd argue that the whole community needs to be more active in that regard.</p>

<p>However, personally I'm not convinced that liberally sprinkling ""<em>Citation required</em>"" post notices around the site will solve any of the problems that you have mentioned.  In fact, I suspect that it would have the opposite effect by diminishing the impact of those notices when they are applied to particularly contentious or controversial posts.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm all in favour of trying to improve the quality of questions and answers on the site, and (speaking personally) I agree that requiring citations to reliable sources that support all non-trivial assertions would be a great step towards this.</p>

<p>However, the fact is that at present we do not have that requirement (notwithstanding Meta posts made almost 8 years ago - which (I think) was about the time that the site was entering its <em>Public Beta</em> phase).</p>

<hr>

<p>As you say, there does seem to be a broad consensus in meta posts here that sources are preferred.  Mark C. Wallace's excellent meta posts:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/618/why-did-my-question-get-a-downvote"">Why did my question get a downvote?</a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3717/why-did-my-answer-get-a-downvote"">Why did my answer get a downvote?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>make it clear that not citing sources for non-trivial assertions is likely to attract a number of downvotes, but - as far as I can see - the community has never actually taken the step of <strong><em>requiring</em></strong> those cited sources.</p>

<p>I don't know why the community never took that final step of requiring cited sources.  But before we start making more liberal use of the ""Citation required"" post-notice (or whatever post-notice eventually replaces it - see below), the community should probably actually first agree that sources <em>are</em> required for all non-trivial assertions in posts on History:SE.</p>

<hr>

<p>You draw comparison with Skeptics:SE.  It is worth noting that they have placed fairly strict restrictions on the type of questions that can be asked there, and also explicitly require that ""<a href=""https://skeptics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2512"">Answers need references</a>"".  That page on their meta site is explicitly cited on their <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">Help Centre page</a> about what types of question are on-topic.</p>

<p>For comparison our <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/tour"">site Tour</a> makes no mention of supporting sources being required, nor do either of these pages in our Help Centre:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">What topics can I ask about here?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer"">How do I write a good answer?</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>The page</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask"">How do I ask a good question?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>does mention sources, but only in the context of asking for them in the event of not being satisfied with an answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""When in doubt, ask people to cite their sources, or to explain how/where they learned something.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>So, we can hardly be surprised when people don't routinely add sources to support their assertions in questions and answers.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>For new, <em>unregistered</em>, users a post-notice will probably make little difference one way or the other.  Many seem never to return to the site anyway.</p>

<p>In the case of new, <em>registered</em>, users a post-notice seems to be rather heavy-handed.  Particularly as the current post-notices are often claimed to be an <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/08/20/upcoming-on-stack-overflow/?cb=1"">unfriendly form of feedback</a>.  In any case I find it hard to square a proposal to add more post-notices to contributions from new users with our desire to be <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3530/are-we-sufficiently-supportive-towards-new-users"">more supportive towards to those users</a>.  </p>

<p>The blog-post seems to suggest that changes in the wording of banners &amp; post notices, together with more anonymity for those providing feedback is the direction of travel at present, so the situation may change in the future.</p>

<p>In the case of relatively high-rep users, I would suspect that they are already aware that answers without sources are likely to attract (negative) comments, downvotes, and even post-notices.  If you've observed people continuing to post answers like that despite this, then I am not convinced that more post-notices are likely to change things.</p>

<hr>

<p>Which brings me to the question of voting.</p>

<p>While in an ideal world people would cast votes purely on the basis of <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/720/24858"">whether a question or answer is useful or not useful to the site</a>, in reality many will simply continue to vote according to whether the question or answer supports their personal world-view.  A post-notice is unlikely to change that.</p>

<p>Many poor questions and answers will undoubtedly continue to attract upvotes almost regardless of anything else we do.  If they are particularly problematic in some way, then people should exercise their downvote privilege, and those with sufficient reputation should vote to close or delete those questions and/or answers.  </p>

<p>If they choose not to do so, then perhaps they do not agree there is a problem - <strong><em>that is what 'community moderation' means</em></strong>.  </p>

<p>As far as I am aware, there is no community consensus to use moderator powers for removing unsourced answers except where they somehow breach other SE rules (for example, racism, Holocaust denial, etc.).</p>

<hr>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>So, in summary, I would say by all means flag answers that you feel require additional citations to reliable sources that support the assertions made in that answer.  However, remember that we do not currently require that questions or answers include citations to support any non-trivial assertions that they make.</p>

<p>Personally (again, let me stress that I'm not speaking with my moderator hat on), I would support the idea that citations should be required, and that our Tour and Help Centre should be updated to reflect this.  I think this would be a great step towards improving the quality of questions and answers on the site.  </p>

<p>Until, or unless, this change is approved by the community, the ""Citation required"" post notice should probably generally be reserved for particularly contentious or controversial answers.</p>

<p>As @sempaiscuba has pointed out in a comment, there are more potential voters than closers. Nonetheless, both the question and one answer have a decent number of upvotes. Closing this question is a clearly against the majority view, and the majority has no means of doing anything about it (however big that majority is). This seems to me to be serious flaw in the system.</p>

Nobody left a comment indicating any detail whatsoever about what was wrong with the question and/or what could be improved to bring it up to snuff, despite you asking. That's our screw-up.</p>

<p>There used to be an auto flag we mods would get if a question got closed without comment, so we could step in and try to at least provide some feedback, but it doesn't look like that happened here. Perhaps because of your comments (but I'd think the flagging software would be smarter than that).</p>

<p>Anyway, I wasn't a close voter, so I can't claim to know their minds. I can only relate what I see which is:</p>

<p>The question seems to fundamentally be asking for insights into the minds of people walking around today, and why they make decisions they are making today, and will probably make in the future. That's just not something our users here, who are mostly steeped in History, are going to have expertise in.</p>

<p>What I always tell people as a good rule of thumb is: <strong>If your question is not posed in the past tense, its probably off-topic.</strong> Its not a law or anything, but its a very strong indicator. Probably 99% of the time it will hold, and the other 1% of times the question is probably tagged <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/historiography"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;historiography&#39;"" rel=""tag"">historiography</a>. The question ""Why <em>is</em> ... "" is clearly using a present tense verb. </p>

<p>I'd suggest it might be easier to get a good answer for that question on an SE site that usually fields questions about Anime or Japanese Comics.</p>

<hr>

<p>Firstly, the question doesn't actually show that the inclusion of Easter Island Moai Culture in comics is a particularly Japanese phenomenon.  The list you linked to actually states that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""the popularisation of other Easter Island cultural artefacts ... has occurred predominantly in the cultural economies of the USA, Japan, and Western Europe""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That list includes many non-Japanese examples, including (for example):</p>

<ul>
<li>Spider-Man</li>
<li>G.I. Joe</li>
<li>Montana Jones</li>
<li>The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest</li>
<li>Les Aventures de Blake et Mortimer [The Adventures of Blake and Mortimer]</li>
<li>Superman: The Animated Series</li>
<li>Dilbert</li>
<li>Justice League</li>
<li>The Simpsons, The Critic, Futurama, and American Dad</li>
<li>Rick and Morty</li>
<li>Inspector Gadget</li>
<li>Wacky Races</li>
</ul>

<p>This point was also made in the (now deleted) comment by Aaron Brick.</p>

<p>So, did the images first appear in Japanese comics, or elsewhere? (If backed by some preliminary research, that might actually be a good question).  When did that popularisation begin to appear in 'the USA, Japan, and Western Europe'? (Again, if backed by some preliminary research, that might also form the basis of a good question).</p>

<p>As it is, the question presented an assertion (that Easter Island such a frequent participant in Japanese Comics - at least relative to other cultures) without much in the way of evidence to support it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Secondly, when I read the question it seemed to me that the images may well simply be a kind of shorthand for ""<em>Polynesian culture</em>"", or ""<em>Pacific Islands</em>"".  This would be in much the same way as comics and movies generally show the Palace of Westminster, Tower Bridge or a Routemaster bus to say ""<em>Now the story has moved to London</em>"", or an image of the Eiffel Tower when they want to say ""<em>Now we're in Paris</em>"".</p>

<p>In my opinion, questions about why those particular objects and places have become sufficiently fixed in the popular imagination to act as that kind of shorthand are probably not generally well-suited to a site like History:SE (although there may well be exceptions).</p>

<p>Equally, it may be that many people find the statues exotic or enigmatic, and that element of 'strangeness' is, in turn, attractive for fantasy stories and comics.  Again, if so, then the question of why that is the case may not be a question well-suited for a site like History:SE.</p>

<hr>

<p>In my opinion, simply tacking the phrase:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Are there any historical reasons for it?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>to a question doesn't necessarily make it a good question for this site.  At the very least, provide some evidence that the question might be one that can be answered using historical methods and sources.</p>

<p>When I read the question, almost every interpretation seems to make it a question about '<em>social sciences other than History</em>'.  So that was the close reason that I chose.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, although I felt that the question was off-topic for this site, I didn't feel it was sufficiently bad to warrant using my moderator 'super-vote' to close it.  As a general rule, I prefer to let the community decide.  However,  when it came up in the normal way in the review queue I simply added my 5th-vote as a regular user of the site.  As Mark C. Wallace mentioned in his comment, ""discussion and deliberation"" aren't generally part of the stack exchange close-vote process.  The question of using comments to improve feedback about why questions are closed has come up several times here (for example <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1981/24858"">Comments discussing reasons to close?</a> and <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3787/24858"">How to improve feedback?</a>).  For now that question remains unresolved.</p>

<p>As for your comments, I simply didn't see them at the time (they were posted 3 days after the question was closed) which is why I didn't try to answer them.</p>

<p>[As mentioned in T.E.D.'s answer, there is an auto-flag that mods get if a question is closed without comment.  In this case, I suspect that Aaron Brick's (deleted) comment meant that a comment had been posted and so the flag was not triggered.]</p>

<p>For what it's worth, in this case the close votes were posted over a period of 24 hours.  After that, comments asking for feedback may not be seen.  Once a question has been closed people simply may not have any reason to return to it and see subsequent comments.</p>

<p>There's a twice upvoted comment in 12 minutes as I write, asking what research got done. I'm one of those upvoters. I did so almost as if I was conditioned to do so. But I'd take it back if I could. The reason I'm asking this question is that upvoting felt wrong for some reason.</p>

<p>It's a valid question. It's an interesting question. It's a non-trivial question. By non-trivial, I mean something that someone who hasn't dug into the topic before will probably not know off the top of their head; and something that you won't know how to google directly unless you know <em>enough</em> about the topic. All of this makes it a good question.</p>

<p>Sure, the answer is probably a few <em>well informed</em> google searches away. Note the operating word: well informed.</p>

<p>But <strong>should requiring that OPs do those [well informed google] searches really be our ""prior research"" criteria?</strong></p>

<p>Doing so seems to me like a recipe to turn the whole site into <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/california"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;california&#39;"" rel=""tag"">california</a> in the long run.</p>

<p>Which is to say, mostly unanswered questions that tend to require hours or more of research to answer. I'm struggling to imagine how we'd miraculously attract scholars on a website whose main means of attracting newcomers is StackOverflow HNQ visitors.</p>

<p>(For Aaron, as I certainly wouldn't want you to take this personally: I relish reading your questions. They're all wonderful, and they set a very high bar on the site. But let's get real here, only a handful of erudite scholars are able to answer many of them. And insofar as I can tell you actually end up answering them yourself on a regular basis -- which also make for great reading when you do. So please continue. My point is that there's little in the way of questions and answers by different people when we set the bar that high.)</p>

<p>Anyway, re-reading the question, it actually seems <em>somewhat</em> researched, if only to the degree that OP read <em>something</em> on the topic before asking, as demonstrated by the fact that they know ""that the people who became wealthy from this event were the ones that were selling supplies to the miners, and not the miners themselves"".</p>

<p><em>Even if we can't find a consensus on how well informed well informed should be, can we at least try to agree here on what we expect as a minimum research requirement?</em></p>

I didn't write any canonical answer there. I posted a <em>suggestion</em> for the wording, to be varied and adopted to the situation from the beginning, and the text/wording is an evolved, collaborative effort. If it can be made 'just friendlier', that's a good thing.</p>

<p>As such I still see problems here </p>

<ol>
<li><p>""well informed"": we can't require askers to already have the answer, but I think we have to require that they opened a book, typed in a search, or <em>something</em>. Not only showing some effort, but also avoiding 'bad'  duplicates, mere answers copying Wikipedia, or answers that require really nothing else than typing the keywords into the search field of a browser. </p>

<p>How does anyone answer any question? By asking questions, sure – but first to oneself, then to resources, then to other people. Outside logic and pure thinking, these are the steps to be taken in succession. And we <em>do</em> want to <em>help,</em> indeed at any point in that chain. But <em>always</em> jumping to 'other people' is lazy and unproductive in the long run. In principle. But especially so if the answer is 'really <em>easy</em> to find'. If it is in fact 'not easy' to find, or problems arise along the way, <em>then</em> 'help' is the most useful. Always asking 'others' first is not 'please help' (""certainly, and gladly""), but ""do my work for me"".</p></li>
<li><p>""elitist""/harsh"":  As said, if it is (often) perceived as 'too harsh', we might change the suggested 'standard comment' anytime, and everyone, now, can take the canned comment and rephrase it to personal preference. As I hoped to make clear in the other thread, personalised and situation aware comments are the real goal for the suggestion!   </p>

<p>Then I do not perceive that as 'elitist' or 'too harsh', in the sense of 'putting down a newbie'. That's of course a matter of taste as well. The suggested comment already evolved from inspiration found on other sites. And everywhere on SE these comments were discussed and improved to exactly that standard: welcoming, friendly, but also guiding and helpful. That process of perfecting is for sure not finished, nor perhaps ever finishable.   </p>

<p>If 'elitist' means: ""we expect a certain standard, (please conform)"" then that's not so good. But if 'elitist' means  ""we expect a certain standard, please conform, and here's how you do it"", then we should all be much more elitist! Community moderation certainly does accept questions that aren't perfect now. But our standards and the quality of posts on this site should be raised, not lowered. Showing askers, newbies, the ropes and guiding and helping them to raise the standard of their own question and that of the site is a good thing.   </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Seeing how long this comment as an answer gets already: One of the reasons, apart from everything listed so far: the comment is what it is now is also found in the character limit of comments. The comment should at the same time be terse, avoiding redundancy, yet contain everything needed. As some of the links in it are needed to 'show how it's done', these often are so long as leading to exceed the imposed character limits.</p>

<p>The main problem I see is not so much found in the ""lying perfectly within the boundaries of history?""</p>

<p>While the topic of the question on main may indeed be served better on other sites, like ""Japanese Mangas &amp; Culture"" (might be in need of creation first, if <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/"">Anime &amp; Manga</a> doesn't suffice), the general core of the question is indeed perfectly <em>answerable</em> from a history angle as well. Although ""as well"" for sure doesn't mean that A&amp;M might not be a better fit after all.</p>

<p>Only that this is just not the problem with the question. It is not very organised and phrased almost confusingly, meandering. We need not an exposé of your general knowledge of what Moais are or where maps from early contacts are now. If anything, these results show to me more that this is <em>not a unique feature</em> of Moais in mangas; more that everyone is easily fascinated by them?</p>

<p>The speculations for the 'possible reasons' aren't marked clearly as being either other's opinions (links?) or what the asker now learned, and just thinks for himself.</p>

<p>No doubt that is a – perhaps desperate – attempt to comply with comments requesting ""prior research"". But in this case it 'just' demonstrates some effort (which by the way <em>is</em> appreciated), unfortunately without adding anything relevant for the question. By relevant I do not mean 'steps to actually answer the question'. But a better description (examples) and more proof that the basic assertion is – or seems to be – actually the case (examples).</p>

<p>That looks to be actually tried with a small link (repeated) to a mostly non-functioning site (it always fails with time-out for me on first attempt to load). A problem that would have been easily overcome by <em>quoting from it</em>, or at least more descriptively summarising it. </p>

<p>In the present form, after 4 edits and a re-open, I am not <em>convinced</em> from reading the question alone that there is something worthwhile for me in it.  </p>

<p>All these points make it for me a slightly confusing, not very attractive question in a field where I have very little expertise. Not very interesting, difficult to answer.</p>

<p>That said: an answer to this – hopefully eventually further refined question – now has to <em>start</em> to ascertain whether that assumption of the asker is actually true: are there many or often Moais in Japanese mangas (or other forms of literature/culture). Especially compared to other comic cultures. If they do feature in mangas: then how often; is this a historically grown popular phenomenon, was it a fad, how frequent are 'frequent occurrences'. If one sees five, seven, 20 or even more mangas that have some Moai, that might still be nothing in the huge market of mangas. 'Nothing' more that is than a simple <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure%E2%80%93ground_(perception)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">figure-ground-perception</a> of a statistical sampling error that just ignores the baseline.<br>
That would make the question's answer quite short? </p>

<p>Now, if that <em>start</em> turns out to be in the negative, the quest is already over. If it turns out to be far from unique for Japanese mangas to feature Moais (like hinted at in sempaiscuba's answer here), then the quest is equally altered fundamentally.</p>

<p>Only if the potential answerer finds positive evidence for what the asker claims: ""Moais frequent in mangas"", do we get into what we should deal with here on HistorySE. Cultural history, history of literature, etc.</p>

<hr>

<p>The comment you think may be too ""<em>harsh</em>"" and ""<em>elitist</em>"" is mine, and I accept full responsibility for it.  It is the form of words that I developed over time, and which have been adopted in a slightly modified form as the <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3843/24858"">suggested 'boilerplate' text</a> for questions from new users lacking prior research.  </p>

<p>So, perhaps some background is in order.</p>

<hr>

<p>The general expectation on SE is that <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/261592/2085030"">SE sites work best if the questions are supported by preliminary research</a>.  This point is also made explicit here on our meta site in Mark C. Wallace's excellent post <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/785/24858"">Why did my question get a downvote?</a>.</p>

<p>I wanted to develop a form of words that would be supportive to new users by clearly explaining just what it is that we expect them to tell us when they ask a question.  I wanted to point them at our Tour and Help Centre, so they would have some idea of what we expect and how SE is different from other sites that they may be used to.  I also recognise that the length of a comment is limited, so brevity would be a good thing.</p>

<hr>

<p>I was fairly clear in my own mind that I needed to know:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Where have they searched</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><em>So that I don't have to duplicate any research they have already done.</em></p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><strong>What they found</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><em>So I don't just post an answer that tells them what they already know.</em></p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><strong>Why that wasn't sufficient to answer their question</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>This will generally tell me <em>what they really want to know</em>.  Did they search, and not actually find anything?  Or perhaps they searched and found a paper that they don't quite understand (both are perfectly valid questions for <em>History:SE</em>, IMO, but they do require very different answers).</p>

<hr>

<p>By late 2017 I had developed &amp; was using this as my basic ""<em>Welcome to the site, but where is your preliminary research</em>"" comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Welcome to History:SE. What has your research shown you so far? Where have you already searched? Please help us to help you. You might find it helpful to review the site <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/tour"">tour</a> and <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help"">Help Centre</a> and, in particular, [ask].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I originally included ""<em>Why was that not sufficient?</em>"" but was told that it sounded ""condescending"", so I've since been leaving it out in most cases.</p>

<p>I posted this as an answer to the meta questions <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3669/24858"">Dealing with newbie questions - again</a> and <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3674/24858"">What should be the standard message for “Please document research”?</a> early last year.  </p>

<p>This was subsequently modified by LangLangC and posted as an answer to the <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3841/24858"">Standard comment situations: suggestions for close votes and down votes</a> meta question.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, obviously, I have been editing this to suit the circumstances.  For example, if the OP has the 'Informed' badge, I cut the bit about the Site Tour.  The fact they have that badge means that they have at least scrolled to the end of the tour.  They may even have read some of it.</p>

<p>If I search for keywords from their question an get an answer on the first page returned by Google, or in a Wikipedia page, then I try to add something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I did a Google search for <code>xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx</code>, the xth result on the first page was the paper xxxxx.  Perhaps you could edit your question to explain what you think is missing from, or unclear about that paper?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps you could edit your question to explain what you think is missing from, or unclear about the Wikipedia article (with link).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>either edited into the question or posted as a supplemental comment.</p>

<hr>

<p>Unfortunately, that approach is often less than successful in dealing with questions that should probably be closed as '<em>Too basic</em>'.  All too often, someone will then take that comment and post it as an answer.  Regrettably (in my opinion) these answers also often attract upvotes, occasionally hit the HNQ list, and/or get tweeted by our <a href=""https://twitter.com/StackHistory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Twitter bot</a>.  This then sends the message that these are examples of what is considered acceptable questions on History:SE.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, is the comment text ""<em>too harsh</em>"" or ""<em>elitist</em>""?</p>

<p>I don't think so.  But then I wrote it, so am perhaps the wrong person to ask.  It reflects how I actually speak in life, and - more importantly - it asks the specific questions that I want the user to edit the body of their question to address.  </p>

<p>I'm not wedded to that particular form of words, but I do want whatever 'boilerplate' text we adopt to ask explicitly for that information.  It is important, and - again in my opinion - should be the <em>minimum</em> that we require for prior research.</p>

<hr>

<p>However, if a majority of the community want something different in terms of what we expect from preliminary research, then maybe we need to settle that in another meta question before we agree on a standard comment text. </p>

<p>This is frankly very frustrating because it appears that those who have closed it have done this simply because the subject is hard and outside of their expertise.  At least, in its present state I cannot see what justifies the claim it is ""primarily opinion based"" when it is about the evolution of a political process.  </p>

<p>I've read the question repeatedly, but the subjective terms in the title distract me from the attempts to define the terms within the question. The title sets the expectation that the question will be an exploration of subjective opinion and that conditions how I read the question. (I believe the title is or should be the question and the question should be the title).  Looking over the edit history it appears that you have done substantial work to demonstrate preliminary research and to try to define the terms, but I'm not sure that the terms are defined in a way that will support an authoritative answer.  I might suggest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why did Russia de-Stalinize while Romania started a personality cult around Ceaușescu?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term &quot;my premise&quot; can also be a danger signal.  Unfortunately while that term is used by people who have thought long and hard, done research formulated a premise, stated it formally, subjected it to initial tests and then revealed it to the world for acid testing, the same phrase is used by people who have done none of those things.  The first type of question is interesting and worthy of effort; the second is none of those things.  Gresham's law as applied to information causes us to assume that the second is true unless we see evidence of the first.</p>
<p>I might suggest (I admit that I haven't thought this through deeply this is off the top of my head</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soviet leaders seemed to alternate between progressive and regressive policy. From Stalin's purges to Khrushchev's thaw, from Brezhnev's freeze to Gorbachev's openness... and then a coup to try and stop Gorbachev.</p>
<p>The general character of repressive policy became less severe each time. Brezhnev's repression never went as far as Stalin's, and Andropov's rule included the first publication of economic facts and anti-corruption efforts. Furthermore, each time liberalization went further than it had before. This does suggest a slow but continual liberalization since the death of Stalin and appointment of Khrushchev.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it were possible to support these conclusions with evidence (Can you cite a summary of the Brezhnev freeze vs Gorbachev's openness?) that would go a long way to conveying the amount of thought in the question.</p>
<p>The question <em>is</em> hard; the answer may not be known and if it is known, it may require a book length answer. There are ways for H:SE to provide answers in those cases, but it is difficult.</p>

<ul>
<li>Latin1 transliteration</li>
</ul>

<p>Languages that don't use the Latin alphabet have a special issue with spelling. You can't just match glyphs, because different languages have different sets of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">phonemes</a> that align only by occasional happy coincidence, and a lot of Eastern languages in particular don't even use alphabets. This means there are often several arguably equally-valid ways to ""spell"" the same word using the Latin-1 character set that English uses. This is why there are so many different opinions on how to spell Qaddafi or Beijing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Self-identification</li>
</ul>

<p>Often when a new group comes to power in a nation or city, they want the name changed as a matter of asserting their identity. This should be respected, just as it should be with a human being who gives your their name or pronouns. This has happened with places like Persia/Iran, Constantinople/Istanbul, Burma/Myanmar.</p>

<p>This can get complicated with exile communities, who for identity reasons insist on the <em>old</em> name. I've encountered this with Iranian exiles, who insist on calling their homeland <em>Persia</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Translation</li>
</ul>

<p>Many place names have a long-standing English name that does not match the word used by residents in their native tongue. The obvious example here is Germany, which to German natives is instead Deutschland. This is a very common issue with non-English speaking areas that use the Latin alphabet.</p>

<p>Names of Mexican cities like Juárez are a special class of this in the USA. Most of us here don't have keyboards that can easily produce that <code>á</code> character, so we don't have much choice but to use an <code>a</code>. However, with the rise of the Hispanic population in the US, there are an increasing amount of people who think it is worth the trouble to pronounce and spell Latin-American cities the way the natives do. Particularly border twin cities like Juárez (which is essentially a suburb of the US city of El Paso, Texas).</p>

<ul>
<li>Regional Pronunciations</li>
</ul>

<p>This can be an issue <em>even within the US</em>. For example, New Orleans is famously pronounced by natives more like ""Nawlins"" (and sometimes jokingly spelled that way). There is a Miami in both Florida and Oklahoma (named after two unrelated Native American tribes), but the one in Oklahoma is pronounced completely differently (more like ""Mie-am-uh"")<sup>*</sup>. Missouri particularly tortures politicians, as everyone in the state is quite convinced that all outsiders pronounce it wrong, proving they don't really understand the place, but the ""right"" way varies depending on what end of I44 you live nearest. If you're going to be on national TV, there is literally no way to pronounce it right.</p>

<p>The point of all this is that these are all very separate issues, and need to be tackled separately. </p>

<p><sup>* - Native American placenames are a special problem in the US. Will Rodgers supposedly told people he was from Claremore because ""nobody but an Indian can pronounce Oologah"".</sup></p>

</blockquote>

<p>It is reasonable to believe that the closers think <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_war_apology_statements_issued_by_Japan#Controversy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the very wiki article</a> I linked to can provide the answer. But I have taken great pain to explain why this article is inadequate, obviously the closers simply ignore it.  </p>

<p>To summarize here: the closers might think that the answer is because the Japan apology is not sincere enough, but I've also asked a follow up question that remains unanswered: <strong>what is preventing Japan from issuing a sincere apology like the Germany did?</strong></p>

<p>There is also a comment suggested that the question should be put on hold because it is asking about the motivations of people:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Questions asking for the internal motivations of people, how specific
  individuals would behave in hypothetical situations or predictions for
  future events are off-topic, because answers would be based on
  speculation and their correctness could not be verified with sources
  available to the public</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this is not about the motivation of <em>individuals</em>. It is asking about the motivation of a <em>country</em>. <strong>In the former case, the individual motivations (most likely) could not be verified with sources, but in the later case, it's different because a country decision can be verified with sources as before it is made, it must undergo debates and can be recorded.</strong></p>

<p>A simple search on History SE reveals a lot of well-received questions do ask about motivations:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/652/2545"">Why did Ford pardon Nixon?</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/28462/2545"">Why did Gen. Lee (Civil War) surrender to the U.S?</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/7802/2545"">Motivation Behind the USSR Assisting China's Nuclear Program</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/33433/2545"">What was the Japanese or Axis motivation to drag US into the War?</a></li>
</ol>

<p>The list goes on and on and on. So the ""reason"" that History SE doesn't tolerate motivation question can't stand up to scrutiny. </p>

<hr>

<p>To take the specific example of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe's 2006 apology, the Wikipedia article notes that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In October 2006, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe's apology was followed on the same day by a group of 80 Japanese lawmakers' visit to the Yasukuni Shrine which enshrines more than 1,000 convicted war criminals. Two years after the apology, Shinzo Abe also denied that the Imperial Japanese military had forced comfort women into sexual slavery during World War II . In addition, Prime Minister Abe claimed that the Class A war criminals ""are not war criminals under the laws of Japan"". He also cast doubt on Murayama apology by saying, ""The Abe Cabinet is not necessarily keeping to it"" and by questioning the definition used in the apology by saying, ""There is no definitive answer either in academia or in the international community on what constitutes aggression. Things that happen between countries appear different depending on which side you're looking from.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Citations for these assertions are included in the original article.]</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, unsurprising therefore that many felt that apology to be insincere.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, consider if Germany had maintained an official shrine to Nazi war-criminals, and that a large group of members of the Bundestag had visited that shrine shortly after the German Chancellor had issued a formal apology for atrocities committed during the war.</p>

<p>Imagine that a couple of years later, the German Chancellor had then denied that some of those atrocities had actually occurred, and argued that in any case, those war-crimes were not actually 'crimes' under German law.  </p>

<p>Do you think that people would have believed the original official apology to have been sincere under those circumstances?</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, I wasn't one of those who voted to close.  However, I did consider doing so on the grounds that it is unclear exactly what you are asking.  There are many different groups and individuals who feel that Japan has never issued a sincere apology for their acts during the Second World War.  When you ask:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why Japan cannot “apologize” enough for World War 2?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>my first question is ""<em>apologise to whom?</em>"".  There will be different answers according to who you ask.</p>

<hr>

<p>To address your supplemental point about up-votes and down-votes in comments, you say that you received 2 downvotes on the main question.  That is incorrect.  The current vote-count shows that you have actually received <strong>5 down-votes</strong> and <strong>4 up-votes</strong>.  </p>

<p>The tool-tip for the up-vote button states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>This question shows research effort; it is useful and clear</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>while the tool-tip for the down-vote button states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>This question does not show any research effort; it is unclear or not useful</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, up-votes and down-votes are anonymous, and people do vote for other reasons (which, I assume, explains the up-votes in this case).  </p>

<p>Well, I quite fundamentally disagree with this.</p>
<p>The recent edit to the question was in my opinion quite superfluous but it didn't change the question to <em>now</em> being off-topic. If the edit would cause this, it has to be rolled back.</p>
<p>The question quality is far from stellar. I further would now still agree to the first round of closing, that is, solely to the reason given: that answers will be quite heavily opinion based. But I wouldn't count that as a valid close reason either, since on SE there is bad subjective and good subjective. Reasoned opinion based answers that argue with valid data points <em>and</em> references are fine with me. That should really be a standard approach here. But enough of that bickering about the example in details.</p>
<hr />
<p>The problem I see here is that we close a question (while often it's said that this is frowned upon if there are answers posted, btw) with such a reason given.</p>
<p>This question is in my opinion very far from too basic. It is a very complicated topic with very different schools of thought and varying approaches.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if it is so much &quot;too basic&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why aren't there answers that pick the easy fruit and answer it properly?</li>
<li>Why isn't there a comment indicating which single Wikipedia or definitive reference source answers this?</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither do I see a comment explaining which single resource is meant with the close reason, nor do I get a satisfactory result if I put this question into a search engine.</p>
<hr />
<p>Note: I do not want to argue over the merits of the question or the deficiencies of the answers. This is not about observing a 'wrong close reason' (but: it <em>is</em> wrong in this case). This is also not about the particular question as such. It is a mere example of the &quot;single link&quot; explaining the close reason better missing from the thread.</p>

<ol>
<li>it provides common ground for would be close/leave-open voters</li>
<li>it explains the close reason better</li>
<li>there are different search engines out there, and especially Google gives strange results (non reproducible, geo censored, alterations based on cookies etc), so the first few links of any given search with <em>defined</em> search terms aren't guaranteed to give the same results for everyone. Then it's often a matter of choosing the <em>right</em> search terms</li>
<li>ideally it should not just 'answer' the question, but give further hints on how to improve the question?<br />
From memory, the most popular way to avoid &quot;answering&quot; the question in comments seems to be to re-phrase that 'answer' as &quot;Isn't that fully addressed in [WP-link]?&quot;</li>

<p>On the one hand, providing that link provides an incentive to the behavior we want to discourage.  It rewards more poor questions and wastes our time.</p>

<p>On the other hand, ... withholding the answer to a question because it is too basic is... perhaps the word I'm looking for is patronizing (the first word that came to mind was 'jerk').</p>

<p>That said, it is apparent that I come down pretty hard on the SE convention that all questions should show evidence of preliminary research or they should be closed early. @sempaiscuba's comment above is, I think, the right response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Which I'd say is fair criticism of <em>[ <a href=""http://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=6&amp;article=1016&amp;context=books&amp;type=additional"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The risk of Fascism in Germany and its Causes</a> ]</em>  . But that should be included as part of the question. At least that would show evidence of prior research. As it stands, that paper appears to answer the question that was asked. And from our Help Centre, Questions answered by a simple Google search or to be found in a Wikipedia page are explicitly off-topic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Italicized portion edited to make a reference clear</em>  Quoted because comments are barn cats and Q &amp; A should stand alone without reference to comments.</p>

<p>On the third (gripping ) hand, I find the structure of <em>this</em> question confusing.  This question contains multiple interwoven questions that need separate answers.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The question in the title is what I chose to answer.  How should we deal with situations where we know the answer, but the OP should have looked it up on their own.  @LangLangC reminds me of the distinction between a <em>lazy</em> question (OP expects us to do research because OP is too lazy to do so)  and <em>hapless</em> question. Without diving too deeply into the second category, I will admit that if OP has made almost any effort to do research, or even just stated, ""I tried to google this but drowned in the noise"", I think we should answer.  There are many things that can complicate research, and if OP has made <em>an</em> effort, I'm willing to leverage that effort to go further.</p></li>
<li><p>The second question is whether the referenced question on fascism was too basic (I abstained from that one because I think that the sample size of fascism is so low that no answer is reliable).  I think the referenced question should have been closed because in the absence of high quality scholarship it is subjective/opinion related. I had expected it to generate more discussion than education. I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong.  (We could discuss bad subjective good subjective here, but doing so in the middle of a complaint that the question has too many components would be hypocritical on my part; I'll save time by stipulating that you'd carry the point.)</p></li>
<li><p>The third question is how we should behave once the first answer arrives.  In my opinion, assuming the answer is of any quality whatsoever, we should leave the question open.  My issue with basic questions is that they waste time, but if someone has chosen to invest that time, then we should acknowledge the invested time.  More generally how do we adapt our behavior in response to events like first answer, first comment, first close request, etc.   I doubt that there is a good answer to this - it is a valid concern, but I don't have much hope that we can provide a constructive answer.</p></li>

<p>However, I suspect that before we invest too much time and effort in that debate, we should first try to come to a consensus about <strong>how much prior research we actually expect</strong>. I was going to post a new question, but - as you can see, it has already been asked. But perhaps we do not yet have a consensus?</p>

<hr>

<p>The <strong>requirement</strong> for prior research is written into Stack Exchange sites.  Every ""<em>How to ask a good question</em>"" page (including <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask"">ours</a>) stresses the need for prior research before posting questions.  </p>

<p><strong>Evidence of prior research is actually a reason to vote up a question</strong>, as stated in the tool-tip for the upvote button:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pAzZr.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pAzZr.png"" alt=""Upvote tool-tip""></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question shows research effort; it is useful and clear</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While equally, <strong>a lack of evidence for prior research is an explicit reason to downvote a question</strong>, as stated on the downvote-arrow tool-tip:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ai8Cf.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ai8Cf.png"" alt=""Downvote tool-tip""></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question does not show any research effort; it is unclear or not useful</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it is absolutely right that the only question we should be ask is <strong>how much</strong> evidence of prior research we expect.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am fairly clear in my own mind about what I need to know when someone asks a question:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Where have they searched</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><em>So that I don't have to duplicate any research they have already done.</em></p>

<p>Note that I don't have any strong feelings here about <em>exactly</em> where they have searched, (beyond the fact that they have at least searched Wikipedia and typed their question into Google - and followed up on any links on the first couple of pages of search results that seem to be '<em>obvious</em>' answers to their question).  </p>

<p>I just want them to tell me what research they have actually done.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><strong>What they found</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><em>So I don't just post an answer that tells them what they already know.</em></p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><strong>Why that wasn't sufficient to answer their question</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>This will generally tell me <em>what they <strong>really</strong> want to know</em>.  </p>

<p>Did they search, and not actually find anything?  Or perhaps they searched and found a paper that they don't quite understand (both are perfectly valid questions for <em>History:SE</em>, IMO, but they do require very different answers).</p>

<hr>

<p>This was the basis for the boilerplate comment text that I developed over time for questions that don't seem to show any evidence for prior research:</p>

<pre><code>Welcome to History:SE. What has your research shown you so far? Where have you already searched? What did you find? Please help us to help you. You might find it helpful to review the [site tour](https://history.stackexchange.com/tour) and [Help Centre](https://history.stackexchange.com/help) and, in particular, [ask].
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Now, once we have come to a consensus about the minimum level of research that we expect questions to demonstrate, perhaps we then also need to address some more contentious questions.  </p>

<p>Two examples come immediately to mind:</p>

<p>Firstly, how do we get the message that <strong><em>these questions really should not generally be upvoted</em></strong> across to the community? This has become even more important since the recent changes to the reputation that is awarded for questions.  </p>

<p>Upvotes should not be a form of ""<em>Welcome to the site</em>"".  Those votes grant reputation which, in turn, unlocks privileges on the site.  <strong>Poor-quality questions that demonstrate no evidence of prior research should never be upvoted</strong>.</p>

<p>(I have recently seen an obvious troll question about the relative numbers of Jews killed by Fascists and Communists get an upvote before it was deleted, which is a matter for concern!)</p>

<hr>

<p>Secondly, should we expect moderators to preemptively place questions on hold, with a comment asking the OP to document their prior research?  </p>

<p>Personally I would prefer that we don't go down this road.  It is certainly likely to make our site feel a lot more unwelcoming, especially for new users.  </p>

<p>However, many of those questions are eventually closed anyway, and since many of our high-rep users seem to prefer not to get involved in user-moderation this might ultimately be a more user-friendly approach. </p>

<p>At least, a question locked by a moderator super-vote can just as easily be unlocked by a moderator when it has been edited by the OP to include their research (whereas moderators might be more reluctant to overturn a community close-vote).  Perhaps this approach would make our process for closing questions less of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapdoor_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">trapdoor function</a>?</p>

<p>Obviously, that wouldn't preclude the question being closed again by the community if there are other perceived deficiencies.</p>

I personally would find it an very good starting point for examining the question, and @MarkCWallace offered an excellent critique of the question. I personally, after reading the Wikipedia entry (included in the question!) found myself baffled as to what else the OP wanted to know, which could not be gained by following the links/references found there. I do find (a personal failing, perhaps) questions that leave me thinking ""Well, what more do you want?"" particularly irritating.</p>

<p>One thing we tried on the (now discontinued) Startups SE was to try to lead by example.</p>

<p>We'd set a theme on meta, and then invite regular users to post questions on that topic. The moderators picked themes from a meta question to coordinate the whole thing. The experiment was fairly successful insofar as I can recollect.</p>

<p>One mistake the mods did was to periodically pick cringeworthy themes. These led to obviously forced questions that attracted very low quality answers. Another mistake was to cycle through themes too quickly. It was one theme per week or fortnight (can't remember); a better rhythm might have been a month or two. These mistakes seem easy enough to avoid if we try it on History.

As you commented on main ""I understand that you want to have some rigor for the site but based on the standards of quality for SE in general"". People coming newly here and looking at older questions should also get some guidance out of old content on how to ask a good question.<br>
It should also serve as some kind of prophylactic: to prevent a commonly seen behaviour: when new people get this kind of comment and don't like it, then they look at prior evidence, or lack thereof, and likely point out ""why me, here, but not there""… This uniform comment might prevent a bit of that.</p>

<p>That comment should also not be read as directed at anyone's personhood or ""value"". It is about and directed at the content. To be honest, I didn't recognise your username and here on meta you do get the automatic ""New contributor"" badge attached. If any of these facts were different or even reversed, I wouldn't actively form any such value judgement of good/bad person. I doubt that the comment on main by Mark reflects anything like that personal value judgement.</p>

<p>That comment is a boilerplate one, standardised and mainly applied indeed to posts coming from new users/low rep users, who post questions that do not reflect a desired quality standard. The intent of this comment is be as friendly as possible while still insisting on raised quality, or a ""better post"" by making suggestions on how to achieve that. Objectively, the question lacks ""prior research"", and in my opinion this decreases automatically from the quality this otherwise interesting core question presents.</p>

<p>That comment is a boilerplate one, standardised and in this case perhaps not entirely correctly applied.<br>
When I see the rep of the poster on such an old question, I would have probably dropped the ""welcome"" part as not appropriate to the situation. (You've been here for a while, and hopefully already know that you are welcome here, or that we try to feel you welcome here anyway, like all users…). However, that is my reasoning for an <em>old</em> question. If <em>now</em> a veteran user <em>and</em> regular would ask such question in this way anew, lacking own research, then I would tend to leave the ""welcome"" in.<br>
This ""veteran status"" is often hard to ascertain. I usually do not check for that, don't go to personal pages, etc. If anything of the above is done on mobile, that interface and the small screen are really great to facilitate making plain errors along the way as well.</p>

For example, the Politics site is almost entirely about people who are still alive, and frankly could not exist with that same rule Genealogy uses. We do have some things in common with Genealogy, but we also have some things in common with Politics. Of course we aren't either.</p>

<p>This site largely concerns itself with things that happened out of most (if not all) of humanity's living memory, almost always involving public figures. So personal privacy issues isn't something that should really be coming up a lot on History.</p>

<p>There <em>is</em> general StackExchange network policy on not displaying excessive PII. If you think that has happened, edit it out and flag it.

<p>However, this is probably the single site on the SE network where this problem is <em>least</em> likely to arise. So I don't believe there's a real need for any special site-specific policy. But certainly if you see something that in your judgement looks like a privacy issue, bring it up.</p>

<p>Honestly, I think our biggest issue with closing questions isn't how quickly we do it, but that very little effort is ever put into rehabilitating held questions. They are almost never reopened, so its effectively a death penalty for questions, and I'm not sure its meant to be that way.</p>

<p>Account <em>Destruction</em> is currently our preferred method of dealing with unregistered new posters making <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3683/site-policy-for-very-heavily-trolled-topics"">bad-faith posts on heavily trolled topics</a>. If an account was made with the intent to post destructive content, we aren't playing around.</p>

<p>Yes, that means spammers too, and theoretically other racist nationalists or self-centered propagandists as well. However, effectively today and for the last few years, it means <em>Nazis</em>. They are the ones attacking us almost daily, so they are the ones actually getting this treatment.</p>

<p>I think I remember one spammer getting destroyed last year. There may have been more the other mods took care of I didn't even notice (because they are that damn good). But effectively, yes you can <strong>take that number as the number of Nazis destroyed last year.</strong></p>

<p>Use the link for last year's report, and you might notice that this is 20% more Nazis destroyed in 2019 than in 2018. So its a legit observation that our Nazi attacks have been getting worse.</p>

<p>Shog9 confirmed on Twitter that this jibes with their observation (presumably network wide). Its not that SE aren't doing anything at their level to help. Its just that the problem has been ballooning.</p>

<p>Any student of history reading this knows what our grandfathers and grandmothers, the so-called ""Greatest Generation"" had to sacrifice fighting Nazisim. Fighting Nazis here and now, where its relatively easy, is the least we can do to honor that sacrifice.</p>

<p>I don't want to leave this on a down note, because the fact is we (and by ""we"" I mean this site as a whole) have been doing a damn good job of keeping this site clean, in the face of what is probably at its root a global societal problem. Perhaps you can't vote out your local Nazis at home, but <em>here is a place where you have the power to fight</em>, and are so far winning. </p>

<p>Few of the actions compiled here were completed by diamond mods acting alone. Even account destructions were almost always flagged by users first. On occasion this even worked so quickly that the account was destroyed <em>before the offending post hit the Time Machine</em>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That's a problem. <em>Only</em> that!</p>

<p>The original question and the original questioners intent <em>should</em> be kept. Perhaps that might not be possible, at all: then I'd say, question was not well suited for this format?</p>

<p>If it is salvageable, keeping the OP's intent intact: then go for it!</p>

<p><strong>Problem being, most of the time:</strong><br>
Questions are often just tossed out, no clarification comes forward even if needed and requested in comments.</p>

<p>Currently, there is just shrugged shoulders as a solution going round. On that I'd personally suggest: either edit it radically after a few days of no-show/no-reactoion, or_ delete the question. — If OP isn't working with the commun ity, the community should either take the licenced-for-modification content and run with it; or reject the premise. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example: This question is good, but probably the poor source (Irving) ruined it.

<p>Examples are judged like OP here sees them. I see them differently. I'll leave it at that unless comments request otherwise, now. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Often we close questions too fast, and few OP actually edit the question to restore it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do not close question <em>fast enough</em>. What we, as a community, do, is unfortunately jumping on questions, 'answering' them, even if the questions are <em>clearly</em> off-topic. Or at least, very sub-standard.<br>
Now, what is or isn't ""off-topic"" may be up for debate.<br>
But we see people voting to close as OT, and then even answering the questions themselves anyway. Plus those who beg to disagree CVs, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hence, shall I try to transform the question and rescue it from the cementery, or it is better to start with a fresh new question?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our main problem is IMO that we see a slew of very low quality questions and OPs not responding to quality improvement requests, at all. Or even arguing about what they see as necessary in comments (without edits to Q!) Quite a load of questions are also really quite bad. </p>

<p><strong>We need faster closing of questions that need closing — and, connected, but <em>not</em> causally linked — more re-openings, but <em>only</em> due to edits to justify re-opening.</strong></p>

<p>If anyone sees a core of a question that is worth salvation despite opposition in the form of DVs, close-votes or bad-sounding comments: if anyone sees any way of clearly and fairly easily improving any question, then we should do that.<br>
The only problem is that OP's wishes and intents should be the guideline. And with unclear questions that is an immanent problem? For that we need cooperation from OP. </p>

<p>If that OP-cooperation is both 'not':<br>
not forthcoming or too difficult to ascertain/guess: then we absolutely should wait a week, then leave the unfixed question to rot &amp; roomba, take the core and ask the core(s) of any question anew. Just properly, this time?  </p>

<p>Therefore, I suggest the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Try to improve the question <em>with</em> OP. (if that fails within 14 days?)</li>
<li>Try to improve the question alongside OP's intent (as best as you can((or have to)) guess)</li>
<li>Take the valuable core of the question and ask it as you see will fit within the guidelines here: reseach it on you own, quote findings and assertions, etc.</li>

<li>addressing broad regions instead of the – asked from the beginning ""capitals"" – in other words using country wide data that includes rural numbers, despite question looking for urban data; including other cities despite only one of them interesting for an answer, with arguably much more modernity in a range of aspects compared to the vast majority of other cities providing data presented in the third hand source used for that answer</li>
<li>presents also a wide range of either peripheral or even completely irrelevant information for answering the question in first <em>and</em> revised form</li>
<li>not in the least a needless detour about dating a peripheral image because answerer embarrassed himself in trying to abuse me and my answer in a now deleted comment below my answer (trying to make an appeal to authority mixed with insults; producing an epic fail in the process; mods: there is entertainment value in it)</li>

  <p><sub>@LangLangC Why? For a general question, giving a answer based on central Europe (Germany, Switzerland and France, based on the available historical data of time) <strong>must</strong> not include other areas not referenced in that answer. As to your <strong>(extremely naive)</strong> reference of the <strong>Potsdamer Platz</strong> I will comment later. (And please remember I have lived in this area for the greater portion of my life and therefore through my historical studies am knowledgeable about the conditions existing at that time.)</sub> </p>
  
  <p><sub>Your (@LangLangC) basic assumptions that the world (based on many of your previous answers) is <strong>back and white</strong> is wrong. Within in a city of 6 million peaple, do not assume that occasionally taken photos of what was (at that time) the ' busiest traffic center in all of Europe' (an area of 250 meters around the Potsdamer Platz) represents the average traffic of the day in that city (of more that 10.000 meters around the Postsdamer Platz). The area North/East and partialy South of the Potsdamer Platz was a govermental or business area. The area west a residential area...</sub> </p>
  
  <p><sub>... This is not an area that slow moving vehicles would travel through. For those knowable, serving Friedrichvorstadt (as the area was called) would of be done from areas north (through the Tiergarten) or south from Schöneberg. Just as it is true today, it was true then: trafic jams are to be avoided. Sorry @LangLangC this is something that someone who attempts to claim to be a historian should know. The world is not black and white, but full of difersities (including the individuals contained within - that aspect which you consistently which to ignore).</sub> </p>
  
  <p><sub>Summa Summarum : The idea that the slowest moving vehicle cannot be seen in occasional photos that are taken 1919 in an area considered to be at the time 'the busiest traffic center in all of Europe' as <strong>absolute proof</strong> that such vehicles don't exist at that time to be <strong>humbug</strong>. Sorry @LangLangC, allthough you have contributed many (for me) informative answers in great detail (which I appreciate) - in certain areas you are one sided and bias. In a politics forum such a behaviour is probably a precondition for participation, in a historical forum the opposite should be true.</sub> </p>
  
  <p><sub>@LangLangC That is what one calls an <strong>educated guess</strong> based on previous knowledge and conclusions (the basis of which much historical 'knowledge' comes from. Thus the statement in the answer <strong>1930 may be considered realistic.</strong></sub> </p>

<p>Most of your criticisms of the question are spot on and I have no argument with them. In particular, the question is/was too broad, unclear and lacks research. All these are good reasons for closing in many cases.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I didn't vote to close (but I did downvote it) and I'll explain why before getting to the re-opening bit. At its core, there is an interesting question here on a hugely important phase in the history of transport. Despite the obvious weaknesses of the question, I felt closing was a bit like throwing the baby out with bathwater. Also, despite the weaknesses in the original, I think a decent answer could have been constructed by someone setting some reasonable boundaries within his/her answer.</p>

<p>Some folks here want quick closure of questions which are too broad, unclear and / or lack research. I strongly disagree as we should (in most cases I think) give people a chance to revise and improve before voting to close. OK, so questions are put 'on hold' first to give time to improve rather than closed, but there is <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/311393/what-is-difference-between-on-hold-and-closed-questions"">little difference in practice</a>.</p>

<p>That said, questions which are guilty of one of the aforementioned offences may also have another fault, the most serious being offensive / poor taste. Questions such as <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/56003/fasc-ist-argument-regarding"">this depraved one</a> must be closed fast (in fact, this one should be completely nuked off the site).</p>

<p>As to why I voted to re-open, I felt the edit had addressed the broadness issue. It still lacked research, but if we routinely started closing questions for that reason alone, we would lose a very large percentage of questions. Downvote them to show disapproval, yes, but closing for that reason alone is going to far. Further, if this question should be closed for lack of research and / or because it is <em>easily</em> answered with a single link (which I dispute - see below), then why not close the following for the same 'offences'?</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>and so on.... If we not just left these open but also heavily upvoted them, why should we not also keep the horse / car transport question open? And if we had closed all of the above, we would probably have been denied some excellent, well-researched answers which are fine advertisements for this site - and thousands of people have seen those quality answers instead of just the few hundred (or none at all) if these questions had been closed.</p>

<p>As to the revised question being answerable with a single link, this does sometimes depend on what the search engine throws up. I googled the revised question and did not get a satisfactory answer despite trying several combinations of key words. The link you found did not turn up in any of my searches.</p>

<p>Finally, being able to answer a question with a single link does not automatically mean the question should be closed (again, we would have to close a lot of questions if that were the case). Wikipedia and certain other links always come up easily (and in such cases the question should be closed promptly), but some others do not, or they may in some searches but not in others. Also, a single link may need some qualifying or expansion to produce a fuller or more satisfactory answer.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT (partly in response to comment):</p>

<p>On 'bad' questions, let's keep a few things in mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>Labelling a question 'bad' simply because it lacks research is an over-simplification. In reality, a question can be good in some ways (e.g. interesting, significant, stimulating, clearly-phrased) but bad in that it lacks research (or vice-wersa).</li>
<li>We can downvote questions which show lack of research or clarity. Having a minus next to a question is a pretty clear sign that questions lacking research (among other failings) are discouraged. </li>
<li><p>Voting to close is only an effective way to discourage poor questions once 5 people have voted. Prior to that, votes to close aren't visible to the new / low rep users who have come here to ask a question. Non-spam/offensive/bad-faith questions often take up to a day or even longer to close, during which time new/low rep users' only way of knowing what the community thinks is by looking at the minus votes next to the question.</p></li>
<li><p>We can and must close and delete questions which are offensive / spam / in bad faith <em>as quickly as possible</em>.</p></li>

Or if Northern Macedonia decided to force ethnic Albanians from the west of the country to secede as they would rather have a more culturally homogeneous country.""</p>

<p>One might argue that it's just a coincidence both are Muslims  but given endemic racist views against Muslims in modern society,  that's not likely, or one should be at least aware of that.</p>

<p>One could argue that it's fair because there is actual tension with these groups,  of course one could use this argument with other racial minorities in societies, exclusion is never acceptable.</p>

<p>If it that doesn't hit home for someone,  imagine one posted something like, 'would it be easier for the rest of this country if they removed the Jewish area from the country rather than assimilate them,  no matter what the Jewish people think. Or what if this country forcible removed a Jewish area as they would rather have a more culturally homogeneous country.' Or if this were replaced by another racial minority,  latino, black, Asian etc. If one argues that one can't be considered racist against a religion, people are racist against whatever group they decide, it's racism, it never makes sense. </p>

<p>The answers and comments may not use removal of Muslims as examples, but the points have already been made, and many may not realize that the OP examples are of Muslim groups. That doesn't change anything. </p>

<p>I flagged this question again with these explanations and still no action was taken. The question been downvoted at least twice. Thanks for reading. </p>

<p>Edit, in response to answers (thank you for the responses):</p>

<p>By Semaphore</p>

<ol>
<li>Yes people choose wording that appears less offensive, ""inner city people"", ""it's not a Muslim ban"", ""separate but equal"", ""final solution"", ""we're only against illegal immigration"", the results are the same, getting rid of Muslims. </li>
<li>The question isn't posited as, ""would China really go as far as removing them?"" It says maybe it would be easier for the rest of China, clearly implying that is how one should think about it. And why would north Macedonia want to be ""culturally homogeneous""? Implying it's preferable to some (or many, speaking on behalf of others, without any disclaimer), as if it's the only lack of homogeneity anyways. </li>
<li>Even if the question were posited in a way, asking if China would really take such measure, why bring up north Macedonia also? Give a little one place, then take it further, is a common method for segregation and whatnot. </li>

<p>By Mark C. Wallace:</p>

<p>It's clear to me. I don't know anyone's background but I think whether or not someone has been (or possibly would be) on the receiving end tends to affect their perception of related scenarios. The majority negatively affects a minority because people create negative perceptions of them. One could argue that the examples wouldn't negatively affect the minorities, but it says regardless what the minority thinks about it, which shows they wouldn't care if it negatively affects the minority, at best</p>

<p>And @Mark C. Wallace commenting on the question ""if there were examples that were ideological or political rather than ethnic or religious."" Is a good suggestion. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">It is not about:</a></p>
<p><strong>Questions answered by a simple Google search or to be found in a Wikipedia page</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see 'a problem' there.</p>
<p>First, the capitalised word &quot;Google&quot; is really an advertisement, unpaid, for <em>one</em> search engine. It is not the genericised 'to google something' (meaning searching the net via <em>an/any</em> engine).</p>
<p>It almost follows from concentrating on this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Google"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">'evil'</a> engine that we disregard two aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What in general is meant with &quot;simple search&quot;?<br />
(First &quot;I'm feeling lucky&quot;-hit after entering a single search string? First 3–5 hits? First 3 pages of entering up to 5 keywords or the entire actual question into the search fields?)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Results from Google are not universal!<br />
The results <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/q/199470"">depend</a> on a long list, not entirely public, of parameters.<br />
It is known that results presented depend on region and/or IP, local <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_by_Google"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">censorship</a> or other laws, cookies set in browser (also from other sites?), status of logged-in or not, personal search history and more (company <a href=""https://searchengineland.com/google-search-quality-crisis-272174"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">doing</a> experiments).<br />
Most bluntly: US users see different results compared to EU citizens or compared to Chinese users? We cannot <em>blindly</em> rely on two people from different parts of the world using the exact same search string to get identical results from Google.<br />
To be clear: other search engines might suffer from this phenomenon as well, although to a much lesser degree. But the point to observe is that two users using Google might see a different list, with different results or in a different order — much like two users using entirely different search engines: dynamically generated content is not a shared and stable frame of reference.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(Apart from making Google results generally less reliable than many might think this also paints the common phrasing in many comments less ideal than they are intended to be: <em>~&quot;literally the first link on Google&quot;</em> — is really just the same as &quot;what <em>I</em> found&quot;. A conclusion from <em>that alone</em> that 'OP didn't search/google' is not necessarily true (although I agree that it makes OP's prior research somewhat less likely to have been done. Again emphasising that this kind of prior research needs more explicit mentioning in any question?)</p>

<ul>
<li>A single link answer found on the first page of a search should be strong candidate for 'too basic'.</li>
<li>Include the other main search engines rather than just 'Google', or don't mention a specific search engine (or use the verb <em>google</em>).</li>
<li>Let's not forget that not everyone is an expert at searching, so let's give a specific instruction. My suggestion would be: <em>Please google your intended title question and check the results before asking here.</em></li>

<p>A '<em>simple search</em>' is just one which does not rely on the use of <a href=""https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">additional qualifiers</a> to return the results you are looking for.</p>

<p>If I enter the title or main keywords from a question into a search engine, and it returns a link on the first page of results that appears to answer the question, then that question is '<em>too basic</em>' according to the definition in our help centre.</p>

<hr>

<p>From my perspective, your second question is linked to the issue of documenting prior research in questions.</p>

<p>Writing an Internet search engine is almost trivial. I've done it, and so have the (thousands) of other students that completed the same (free) course on Udacity.  </p>

<p>The difficult bit is sorting the (potentially millions of) results that you obtain.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://99firms.com/blog/search-engine-statistics/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google accounts for between 75% and 95% of searches</a> because they do that part '<em>better</em>' than other search engines (which is precisely why their algorithm isn't public!).</p>

<hr>

<p>I suspect that whoever wrote the text for our Help Centre (it was before I joined SE) used the capitalised form of 'Google' simply because Google <em>are</em> the dominant search engine. </p>

<p>(I tend to use Google for history-related searches because I find that it returns the results I'm looking for more reliably than any other search engine that I have tried.)  </p>

<hr>

<p>The reality is that, if the OP hasn't documented their research, then the most likely scenarios are that either</p>

<ol>
<li>they haven't done any research, or that </li>
<li>any Internet searches they did were carried out using Google.</li>
</ol>

<p>But for our purposes here, that is still largely irrelevant.</p>

<hr>

<p>For me, the 'acid-test' is this:</p>

<p>If I enter the keywords from the question into Google, or any other search engine, and find a result that appears to answer the question, I'm generally going to assume that would also be the case for the OP, <strong>unless they have documented their research to show that they did search and didn't get the same hits on whatever search engine they are using</strong>.  Their question is thus off-topic, according to the definition in our Help Centre.</p>

<p>In cases like that, it should be up to the OP to show that the question is, in fact, on-topic.</p>

I understand that this needs to be tackled because it clutters up the site with irrelevant stuff and makes it hard to identify those comments that are helpful. I understand that this causes a major amount of work and that the moderators have a very difficult job dealing with this all the time. I understand that it has therefore become standard practice to move the entire comment section of a post to chat as soon as a discussion develops, discussion being understood as contributors replying to each others comments.</p>

<p>However, I feel that comments are sometimes moved to chat so fast that I find myself considering whether to add comments at all. In particular for comments that require some effort, comments with additional information or suggestions how to improve the question or answer. I do not think the chats the comments are moved to are normally read by anyone, least of all the author of the post the chat is about. Further, they are automatically deleted if they have less than 15 comments and there is no new activity for seven days. (There rarely is.) If I can expect my comment to be buried in such a chat (or deleted directly, as it happens) within a few hours, it does not seem worth looking up sources etc. This also defeats the purpose of comments.</p>

<p>To be clear, I do not want to dispute that <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3631"">comments are barn cats</a>. It is clear that they are meant to be temporary. Nevertheless they have a purpose and we should make sure that they can fulfill this purpose. In terms of <em>T.E.D.</em>'s metaphor, if our barn cats die so quickly that they are ineffective at pest control, this might be a problem.</p>

<p><strong>Why I feel this is bad</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>It encourages posting comments as answers instead.</em> My feeling is that we are seeing an awful lot of very bad answers: Short comments, quotes copied uncritically from somewhere, or brief explanations without any sources or references. Sometimes this is even the case for long-time contributors with a lot of reputation. </p></li>
<li><p><em>It is exploitable.</em> If I would, for whatever reason, want to post a ludicrous answer (say, to promote a particular ideology), I can expect to be called out on this and the answer to be downvoted. However, if comments flagging my answer as biased are moved to chat as soon as some discussion arises in the comment section (because then all comments are moved to chat), I can simply start a discussion and wait it out. Within 3 weeks, there will be no trace left of the comment I wanted to get rid of, my post will perhaps still be the only answer to the question and people will start upvoting me. Easy. Nice way to promote antisemitism for instance.</p></li>
<li><p><em>It discourages putting any time and effort into comments.</em> For instance, if we have a new contributor posting a bad question, wouldn't it be nicer if she got some personalized feedback from someone who takes some time to do that. Instead, she can expect the standard comment, copied for the 50000th time. Another example: If I comment about some aspect missing in an answer, should I just mention this aspect or should I look up and suggest a reference? If the comment will be gone within a few hours, it does not seem worth the effort.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Other considerations</strong></p>

<p>I realize that the author of the post should integrate any relevant information from comments into the post. You could argue that comments should therefore be removed as soon as the original author has seen them; if she has replied, it is clear that she has. And if she deemed it relevant, she would have integrated the information in the original post. However, this is very rarely done. I suspect this is because 1. It takes effort and time (that you may not have every day); 2. It feels wrong to many people; like appropriating other people's contributions; 3. It is not usual to see other people do that.</p>

<p>I also realize that you can edit posts directly to integrate additional information. However, I feel this option should only be used if you are really, really sure that what you are adding is uncontroversial and does not change the spirit of the original version of the question or answer.</p>

<p>Note that there was <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4003"">another recent discussion about this</a>. Maybe this shows that other contributors (in that case <em>Gort the Robot</em>) are concerned as well (although the issue was deletion, not moving to chat). </p>

<p>I understand that there are other opinions on the roles of comments and answers: A comment (how ironic!) by <em>LangLangC</em> <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4004"">here</a> suggested that comments with ""half-answers"" should be answers, not comments. I respect this opinion, but I fear what that would do to the quality of the answers on History:SE and therefore I believe instead that some answers that only contain ""half-answers"" should have been comments instead.</p>

<p>There was in fact <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3625"">an entire discussion about whether ""answer-comments"" should be subject to arbitrary deletion like other comments</a>. Some opinions were collected, a comment linked similar discussions on other SE sites, but there did not seem to be a consensus. Curiously, no one mentioned what I would think would be the obvious way to deal with ""answer-comments"" with ""half-answers"" (integrate the relevant information from these in the post they comment on, then flag them for deletion).</p>

<p>To that end, <em>any time some comments are hidden</em> (and thus new comments will be hidden) we are already in sub-optimal territory with the question's comments. If someone sees and reports a new problem with the post, most people will not see it. The more comments there are, the worse this problem is.</p>
<p>Moving comments to chat is a vital tool to fix this issue. If something needs to be discussed at length, particularly with back and forth messages, that's a venue designed for that activity. From that point on, what I'd like to see is few enough comments that posters can see some comments got moved to chat.</p>
<p>The only other tool we have available is deleting comments. That works great too, but is a bit of a shame if there's something people found valuable in one of the deleted comments.</p>
<p>Of the points raised in the question, I'd say:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I really don't think this has been much of a problem. When I service legit &quot;not an answer&quot; flags, its effectively <em>always</em> a new user with a rep below the commenting privilege's, who most likely saw the &quot;post answer&quot; interface and assumed that's how everyone else was posting those comments they saw. (Full disclosure, I did that myself back in my noob days).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Never seen that happen. This looks like an invented scenario that relies on the humans in the loop acting like dumb machines, which is <em>not</em> in my experience how things are done here.</p>
<p>A more typical example I'd see would be one highly upvoted comment, followed by a multiparty discussion with the author. What we try to do there is leave the first comment, and then the next one should be &quot;This discussion has been moved to chat.&quot;. People who think, &quot;I have that problem with this post too!&quot; can click to upvote the comment, and people who want to engage in a discussion about that issue can (and should) go to the chat and do so. When/if the comment's issue is resolved, we can then remove that original comment too, but perhaps keep the chat link.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Exactly backwards. <strong>A post having too many comments discourages any new good comments.</strong> If I see a post with 27 comments on it, its almost guaranteed that anything <em>new</em> I have to say about it will be the proverbial <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_in_the_Wilderness"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">voice crying out in the wilderness</a>. For someone to see it, they'd have to see that number, not be intimidated by it, click the &quot;more&quot; link, then read through all previous 27 comments without getting distracted, bored, or called away for something in Real Life more important. Comments sort of obey the law of Supply and Demand; the more there are, the less valuable they are.</p>

<p>Part of that is systemic design failures. Comments can be voted up but not down etc. For all that's wrong coming down from SE top, we can not do much about, just try and circumvent the problems.</p>

<p>But despite comments being second class citizens among posts, with their rights being revokable at any time, some things I observed that might need achange:</p>

In the latter case I keeo asking myself why the move to chat was activated anyway?   </p>

<p>What are we supposed to do with comments moved but chat not available? </p></li>
<li><p>Does it have to be that way? It seems mods get quite deletion trigger happy after a move to chat and any new comments appear. Letting me wonder why they don't prune the comments earlier, more often — either before the thread-length alarm goes off or when it does. I know that those can get <em>very</em> long. In the sense of 'mods decide to keep just all' that's posted below a post.</p>

<p>It is really not good that nonsense comments, VLQ comments etc get the same weight and retention value by moving those to chat as well, while they by sher annoying presence also trigger the move in the first place. </p>

<p>So, what I'd like to see is that </p>

<ul>
<li>more comments getting pruned by mods, cleaned up by users (self-deletion, flagging) </li>
<li>especially when a length alarm goes off, that the first reaction should be to prune obsolete or LQ comments, not 'just move to chat'</li>
<li>move to chat is not implemented before there are really 16 messages to preserve (to avoid chat deletion, except that is the goal?)</li>
<li>move to chat is to be tried to be avoided, by mods (if that is possible and my guess is that this depends a bit on whether that alarm is raised again after perhaps repeated pruning?)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Comments are not ideal, I agree. As per theory, they are even bad. But some comments are needed, some are useful, and chat is much worse for that.</p>

<li><p>Good answers should, if possible, present the state of the art view of historical science on the question, not just one non-neutral perspective (and certainly not just one quote).</p></li>

<p><strong>Normally I would downvote and comment on how the answer can be improved</strong>. This is not an option in the present case, because <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4027"">History:SE's current policy on comments causes my comments on this to be deleted immediately.</a> </p>

<p><strong>Alternative suggestions</strong> are to </p>

<ol>
<li><p>write a better answer which would presumably be upvoted. This can only be done by someone who has enough insight to give a better answer that is not superficial. It does not allow people who are no experts on the matter of the question (early modern Spain) to raise the problems with this answer.</p></li>
<li><p>edit the answer and improve it. The answer currently has a flag recommending the latter. I do not think this is a good way to handle things, since it would change the nature of the answer substantially and in a way that the original author may not be happy with.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: </p>

<p>There was a bit of discussion about this <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1560/the-time-machine"">in the chat</a> resulting in the recommendation by multiple people that there should be a Meta question about this.</p>

<p><strong>Edit (Feb 3 2020):</strong> in response to a comment about biasedness being subjective</p>

<p><em>I do not think it is true that biasedness is subjective.</em> Opinions, perspectives, viewpoints may be subjective. But if a source selectively presents evidence for one viewpoint while ignoring others that are commonly accepted as valid perspectives among historians, then the source is biased. 
Note that following this approach, the biasedness may change over time as more information becomes available while an old historical text (that could not possibly have been aware of that information) cannot be updated. This does not invalidate the text as a historical source, it just means that it is not up to date any more and must be seen as biased by the common viewpoints of the time when it was created. </p>

<p>For instance in the context of the present example (the ultramontanist Ludwig von Pastor): In the 1800s, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_infallibility"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">papal infallibility</a> was a hotly discussed topic and the view that the pope could not possibly be wrong was not uncommon even among historians. Although non-Catholic historians surely held a different opinion, it would in itself not have seemed outrageously wrong. This was before we had modern psychology. In the light of the findings of modern psychology, claims of the infallibility of a human being would appear ridiculous. The Catholic Church has adapted to this (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_infallibility"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">starting in 1870</a>), and so has historical science.</p>

<p>Another example is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">scientific racism</a> which was very much a thing at the time of Ludwig von Pastor. There were respectable scholars at the time who expressed antisemitic ideas in their writings. Today, this is not done any longer, old sources that do that are seen as biased, and quoting these without providing context is not acceptable.</p>

<p>Doing a Google search, I found this Wikipedia page for ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahwism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yahwism</a>"", which states that it refers to the monolatristic precursor religion to Judaism. However, I've also heard the term used in Christian circles to refer to the monotheistic religion practiced by the ancient Hebrews prior to the destruction of the Temple by the Romans, as a way of distinguishing it from modern rabbinic Judaism, which evolved from one particular sub-sect of that faith (the Pharisees).</p>

<p>As such, I was considering proposing a tag usage of something like the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This tag is for questions related to the monolatristic or monotheistic worship of Yahweh by the people of the ancient kingdoms of Judah and Israel/Samaria, prior to the destruction of the Temple and the Jewish Dispora.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I realized that this might potentially be controversial, though, and since I don't have the reputation to create new tags or to create tag synonyms, and since it appears that there might be multiple ways to spell the word, I figured it might be best to ask Meta for their opinion.</p>

<p>By comparison, the tag usage information of the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/judaism"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;judaism&#39;"" rel=""tag"">judaism</a> says the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Judaism is both a religion and an ethnic identity. Its religious component is predicated on the Hebrew Bible and other literatures, and is a monotheistic faith. As an ethnicity, Judaism embodies the culinary and literary cultures of Jews throughout history. Many Jews today are not religious, but see themselves as part of the Jewish people. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can see, however, a few questions about the predecessor faiths to modern Judaism tagged under that question, so perhaps breaking the tag apart might solve things? Maybe even break it down further into a ""Judaism"" tag for questions about the modern Jewish religion, and ""Jewish People"" or ""Jewish Culture"" tag for questions about the ethnicity; there was a comment suggesting that we should avoid ""overloaded"" tags. The <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/judaism"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;judaism&#39;"" rel=""tag"">judaism</a> tag's only got about thirty questions, so it shouldn't be too hard to do manually.</p>

<p>I can only give <strong><em>my opinion</em></strong> of why <strong><em>I</em></strong> <em>might</em> have voted to close those questions.  This will necessarily be subjective.</p>

<p><strong>Again, let me stress the usual caveat that these are only <em>my personal opinions</em>, so please ignore any moderator diamond you might see next to my name.</strong></p>

<p>Firstly, let me be clear.  You say that you weren't ""... <em>trying or planning ""to promote or discredit"" anything</em>. ..."", and I accept that statement at face value.</p>

<p>However, it certainly <em>appears</em> to me when I read those questions that at least three of them were doing exactly that (and that <em>appearance</em> is what is being referred to in the close reason).</p>

<p><strong><em>Please note also that these questions have since been deleted by the system, and so will not be visible to users who do not yet have <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/privileges"">sufficient reputation</a>.</em></strong></p>

<p>Firstly, your question <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/56273/24858"">Why was René Faulques so honored by France if he attacked for a dictator against ONUC?</a> includes the statements:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I'm interested in second opinions to this <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5oumxi/eli5the_french_foreign_legion_and_the_siege_of/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">r/ELI5</a>"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Surely such a man is not worthy of respect from France let alone official government honours?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, to my eyes, that reads very much like ""<em>I didn't like / don't agree with their answer to my question, so I'm hoping for a different answer here</em>"". </p>

<p>Or, to put it another way, ""<em>I think this person didn't deserve that respect and I'm hoping you will validate my opinion</em>"".</p>

<p>Now, while that may not have been your intent when you wrote the question, it is certainly how it <em>appears</em> to me when I read it.</p>

<p>And yes, if I had read that, and I didn't have the moderator ""super-vote"", I might very well also have voted to close the question as a ""push-question"".</p>

<hr>

<p>Similarly, your question <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/56277/24858"">Why weren't mercenaries from G20 countries prosecuted, or lose their citizenship?</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why did G20 country intentionally ignore wrongdoing, and fail to prosecute?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The implication being that:</p>

<ul>
<li>those mercenaries had not only done something ""wrong"" (surely a matter of subjective opinion?), but that they had broken some law in their own countries (after all, you cannot be prosecuted if you haven't broken the law), </li>
<li>that they <em>should</em> therefore have been prosecuted, and </li>
<li>that, despite all the above, those countries decided not to prosecute.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or, to put it more accurately, when I read your question, it <em>appears</em> to be promoting that idea.</p>

<p>Once again, had I seen it, and if I had a regular user's close-vote, I might well have voted to close this one as a ""push-question"".</p>

<hr>

<p>The same reasoning holds true for your question <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/56275/24858"">Were the countries that gave the mercenaries to support the rebels held accountable?</a>.</p>

<p>To me, reading this question, it certainly <em>looks like</em> you are saying that those countries <em>should</em> have been held accountable by someone (although I'm not sure who you think that should have been).</p>

<p>And because it reads that way to me, as before, had I seen it etc., I might also have been tempted to vote to close this one as a ""push-question"".</p>

<hr>

<p>The last question, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/56278/24858"">How many G8 mercenaries were executed by African countries?</a>, is rather different.  </p>

<p>This one really doesn't look like a ""push-question"" to me. (Although I might still have been tempted to vote to close it for being too broad / needing more focus.  There have, after all, been a lot of post-colonial conflicts involving foreign mercenaries in Africa!)</p>

<p>I did notice, however, that all four questions were posted in just under 20 minutes (between 06:42 and 07:00 GMT on January 19). </p>

<p>Given that this question was posted so soon after the other three questions (which, as explained above, do read like ""push-questions"" to me), and the similarity of the subjects, it's possible that I <em>might</em> have felt it was part of a broader pattern, the four questions being different aspects of the same agenda.</p>

<p>So it is possible that I might also have voted to close all four questions as ""push-questions"".  On balance though, I think it's more likely that I would have voted to close this one for being too broad.</p>

<hr>

<p>As for how to write ""better"" questions?  All I can say is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep it on-topic for the site</li>
<li>Be clear <em>and specific</em> about what you are asking.</li>
<li>Keep the language in your question neutral.</li>
<li>Share your prior research.</li>
<li>Take a moment to read your question before you post it.  Will others read it as you intended?</li>
</ul>

<p>I read somewhere that:</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>

<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>interesting blogs</li>
<li>helpful resources on the subject matter</li>
<li>cool events or conferences</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>

<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>

<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>

<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>

<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</code></pre>

<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The question must always be tagged with the magic <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Image requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.</li>
<li>Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)</li>
<li>Must be GIF or PNG</li>
<li>No animated GIFs</li>
<li>Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB</li>
<li>If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Score Threshold</h3>

<p>There is a <strong>minimum score threshold</strong> an answer must meet (currently <strong>6</strong>) before it will be shown on the main site.</p>

<p>You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/4045"">here</a>.</p>

I was one of the original users in 2011, T.E.D. came about a year later, and several of our most active members joined within the past 2-3 years. I don't remember the sequence of events, but my recollection is that sometime between 2011 and ""now,"" a ""request for sources"" became off topic, which was not the case in 2011.</p>

<p>What has been done on other sites is to put a ""historical lock"" on the earlier question so that its current form and answers cannot be altered. The accompanying text is that this question is being preserved because of its historical significance, but is not considered a good, on-topic question today, and should not be considered as an example of such.</p>

<p>This is one of the two things that the current moderators can do to the earlier question. The other is for them to rule that it is ""still"" on topic, meaning that yours would be too. My preference is for the latter, but others may disagree with me.</p>

It looks like this may be an opportunity for some of those messages we would like to get out to prospective users, and perhaps we can crowdsource here what might make for effective use of our 'ad' space. Perhaps post an answer describing a concept and then comments,edits and votes to select or help fine tune favorites? </p>

<p>Some other ideas someone might run with:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Holocaust question? click here first.</strong>  With link to meta discussion explaining our higher standards  on holocaust questions.</li>
<li><strong>Homework Question?</strong> {possible second line <em>Don't ask</em>} -link to a meta discussion showing why we can't do their homework for them, </li>
<li><strong>New User, Take the tour</strong></li>
<li><strong>Don't forget to accept the best answer</strong> I've seen this one somewhere else...</li>
<li><strong>Nazi Troll??  Go Away</strong> with the required Indiana Jones poster (OK,this one might be taken as a challenge[counterproductive] or might
not meet our 'friendly' community standards...)</li>
<li><strong>Keep your <em>isms</em> to yourself</strong> over word cloud of nazism, sexism, racism, ... with a link explaining push questions</li>
<li><strong>Visit meta, help define the rules!</strong> image of blind justice, or scales of law</li>
<li><strong>Want a book recommendation, ask a Librarian</strong> with link to source requests being off topic</li>

<p>You can see there are quite a few issues we deal with <em>repetitively</em> here, which an occasional 'ad' helping to pre-inform users of policies or possible issues might just improve the site flow. </p>

<p>I didn't vote to close, so I can't answer why people voted as they did.  I can offer a few observations that <em>might</em> be useful.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/785/1401"">No preliminary research</a>.  Like most SE sites, we expect questions to contain evidence that the poster has made an effort to solve the problem; we're looking for preliminary research. This isn't a hard and fast rule (although it is referenced in [Help]), but questions without preliminary research are closed more often than those with preliminary research.  </p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3882/1401"">Discussion in comments</a>. I haven't studied it formally, but my impression is that questions are more likely to be closed when the original poster adds comments to the post.  OP replying in comments makes it difficult to understand the comment and encourages <em>discussion</em> in comments, which is an anti-pattern.</p></li>
<li><p>Breadth of question - I'm hesitant to mention this one because you're asking about a period and culture where I have limited knowledge, but my initial gut reaction is that the question is too broad - that there may be many answers depending on the specific city/region and time period.  I know that if I ask my professional historian girlfriend how middle/lower class women dressed in Europe, the answer will be ""it depends"", followed by a half hour lecture with illustrations and examples.  While I don't know, my impression is that we have stronger documentation on Europe than on Early Islamic Arabia. (I would be happy to be wrong on that point; I'm always happy to discover there are more sources than I estimate).  I'm concerned that there may not be an authoritative answer to the question.</p></li>
<li><p>Prurience - This is entirely speculative.  I can tell you that when I read the phrase ""slave girls"", I have a knee jerk negative reaction.  I'm predisposed against the question.  I'm going to hold the question to a more stringent standard for other qualities (preliminary research, clear focus, objective, authoritative, etc.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Only those who voted to close can explain why the voted to close (and I strongly support their right to remain silent on their reasons), but I don't think you really care why people voted to close; I think you want to know how to get an answer to your question.  Hope that some of that helps; we could use more questions about non-European history.</p>

<p>History is unlike other online forums (such as mailing lists, bulletin boards, and the commenting systems on blogs.) History is also subtly different from  other web sites in the Stack Exchange family. We're unique, and we'll admit that we take some getting used to. We think it is worth it and we hope you will too.</p>
<p>History:SE can appear to be <em>a little hostile</em> to new users. Many first time users — perhaps even most first time users — are surprised when their contributions are judged against an unexpected set of standards. I urge you not to be disheartened by this. Have a look around, and you will quickly understand how we work.</p>
<p>We hope that you will soon learn to appreciate the value that these standards bring in ensuring that the answers you find very high quality, and, importantly, reliable.</p>

<h1>Questions (and answers) should be supported by preliminary research</h1>
<p>Stack exchanges differ on how much prior research is required. We're closer to the science/engineering side. We expect that the question will contain evidence of the research that you've already done. If it doesn't, you're likely to get a comment like the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could you edit your question to clarify where you've searched and what you found already, complete with links and references, and context if applicable? In particular, please let us know what you find missing or unclear about the Wikipedia entry on the topic, if one exists. This allows those who might want to answer to do so without needing to redo the work you've already done. You might find it helpful to review the site [tour] and [help] and, in particular, [ask].</p>

<p><strong>Rationale: why do we close questions?</strong></p>

<p>There are really two ways to do moderation. If you've been on any of the <code>.moderated</code> newsgroups you'll be well aware that to get a post on there, it needs to undergo a review process first and be accepted. The aim is to keep problem discussions from arising.</p>

<p>StackExchange is slightly different – it works the other  way. <em>Anyone</em> can ask a question on SE and closing a question is the equivalent of putting that question <em>back into review/improve mode</em>. It's a feedback mechanism designed to react to problem cases only, so the usual business of asking and answering good questions can just… <em>happen</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Why do we close a question?</strong></p>

<p>The philosophy of StackExchange is that each site handles questions on <em>problems you face</em> or things you are trying to understand. The <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask"">don't ask</a> section of the HelpCentre gives you a good overview of things that don't work – to summarise:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some questions invite arguments or extended debate that suck up time when members could be helping other people.</li>
<li>Some questions are too broad, too narrow or have other content problems.</li>
<li>Some questions belong elsewhere.</li>
<li>All questions must be about <a href=""https://skeptics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1491/how-should-we-enforce-notability"">history</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, all questions should be able to generate an authoritative answer.  This means that list generating questions frequently get closed, as do requests for references where there is the possibility of subjectivity.  The best questions are those where any impartial observer can look at the answers and recognize the answer that most effectively answers the question.  </p>

<p>These have been worked out over time and with a lot of experience from Stack Overflow and are, <em>broadly speaking</em> true. Sometimes, exceptions are made – it is always a case-by-case thing.</p>



<p><strong>Is Closing the same as Deletion?</strong></p>

<p>If enough people 'vote to Close' a question, it is 'closed'. It is called 'closed' to emphasize that it is a different concept to 'deletion'. </p>

<p>'Closed' questions are put into ""improve mode"" if you like, and are still visible for <em>anyone</em> to improve. That's the idea. Deleted questions are different – they have a different background colour and are even invisible to all but high reputation users. So deletion is different and solves a slightly different problem.</p>

<p>Closed questions can still be edited, and people are still encouraged to give them the love they need to become good questions.</p>

<p><strong>What are the requirements for closing a question?</strong></p>

<p>If you have 3000 reputation, you can vote to close any question for the reasons above. More on that in a moment.</p>

<p>If you do not have this level of reputation, you will find that under the flag menu, you have an option ""should be closed…"". That will 'raise a flag' for users: those are alerted who <em>can</em> 'vote to close'.</p>

<p><strong>Why can anyone vote to close/reopen</strong>?</p>

<p>Firstly, anyone can vote to close or reopen (or flag as such) because it is <em>your site</em>. This is really important – it's about expressing what you feel works and doesn't.</p>

<p><strong>How are moderators different?</strong></p>

<p>Moderator close votes complete the required vote count immediately, no matter how many people have voted. This applies for both close/reopen votes.</p>

<p>Initially, the reputation requirement ruled out many users, and you will see moderators did most of the closing to guide the site and look after the content. As community members gained reputation, they get to join in.</p>

<p><strong>Ok, so how does it work?</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qogGL.png"" alt=""Example close button""></p>

<p>Ok, the important piece. Voting to close works like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Underneath the question, there will be a close link. When you click on this, you will be presented with a list of options from which you can pick a close reason most appropriate to the situation.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/THms0.png"" alt=""Close vote reasons dialog""></p>

<ul>
<li>If other people have voted, you will see blue numbers against the reason they chose.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/69Kak.png"" alt=""Other votes""></p>

<ul>
<li>The exact duplicate page takes you to a page that allows you to specify a question to close as an exact duplicate against.</li>
<li>The ""off topic"" page will present you with two options - one to migrate here, to meta, and one just off topic. On SE betas, only moderators can send questions elsewhere, so feel free to cast a vote here and flag if you have a target in mind.</li>
<li>The other options are straight out closes.</li>
<li>Once you pick your option and click ""close"", your vote is registered. You cannot retract it at this stage, but nobody else, including moderators, will know it was you who voted.</li>
<li>If five people agree, the question will be put on hold. You've seen the effect of these before.</li>

<p><strong>How does vote to re-open work?</strong></p>

<p>A question that is 'Closed' has a ""reopen"" link underneath it. If you click this, a dialog box will ask you if you are sure - click yes and your vote will be registered to re-open the question.</p>

<p>Below, you can see an example of the re-open link with two votes registered for re-opening (out of five).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/syw4O.png"" alt=""Re-open link""></p>

<p><strong>What happens if I make a mistake?</strong></p>

<p>Don't worry! Unless five people agree, or a moderator agrees, the question won't be closed. </p>

<p><strong>I've seen an on hold question and I disagree. What can I do?</strong></p>

<p>Well, one option is to use your re-open vote! You can also always raise a discussion here on meta to seek clarification on why a question is closed and hopefully either a resolution will be reached, or you will get an explanation for the closure. </p>

<p><strong>My name appears on the bottom - isn't this going to cause problems with other users?</strong></p>

<p>Actually, surprisingly few closed questions generate any response at all.</p>

<p>However, if you experience difficulties as a result of closing a question, you can and should contact a moderator via the flag mechanism (which is anonymous). We can then take any necessary action.</p>

<p><strong>How do I find questions I might need to close? What about re-opens?</strong></p>

<p>Actually there are two tools for this. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/review"">Review</a>. Here, there are a number of options for seeing things that might need say editing. One of these is a tab for all questions with close votes. You are then free to look at the question and decide if you agree.</li>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/tools"">Tools</a>. Commonly referred to as the ""10k tools"", this page let's you see even more information - certain anonymous flags, re-open votes, delete votes etc. The important one for this is the re-open page. Here, you can see questions that might have been closed incorrectly.</li>

<p>One dimension of the difference is that Venice was mostly hedonistic, valued the display of wealth, whereas Dutch culture favoured modesty.

Before that, users can suggest edits, but these need to be approved by higher-rep users via the review queues (or by the OP of the post).</p>

<p>Now, improving the quality of questions is generally a good thing.  I would argue that improving question quality adds value to the site as a whole.  However, the guidelines in our Help Centre also state that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tiny, trivial edits are discouraged - try to make the post significantly better when you edit, correcting all problems that you observe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Editing a post also bumps the question to the top of the homepage. Please be mindful of this and make your edits count, so that the new attention is brought to something substantial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, this guidance is a little vague and given that we get relatively few new questions per day, it is still possible for these edits to flood the homepage and drown out these new questions.</p>

<p>(In my opinion, this can be a particular problem with <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/tagging"">tag edits</a>, where re-tagging a batch of questions can easily flood the homepage, and where tags may often be being added (again IMO) incorrectly. 
Tags should be used to define the <em>topic</em> of the question.  A place, person or other entity is not necessarily the topic of a question simply because they are mentioned in it.)  </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>So, do we need to establish more explicit guidance around editing?</strong></p>

<p>We are not the first site to experience this problem.  For example Aviation:SE has established some <a href=""https://aviation.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3691/what-should-we-do-if-a-user-wants-to-create-a-new-tag-and-apply-it-to-old-questi"">guidance</a> to avoid similar problems recurring there.  I believe that other sites have also created guidance on their meta sites.</p>

<hr>

<p>Some questions that occur to me are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should we set an <strong><em>explicit</em></strong> upper limit on the number of edits a user should be allowed to make in a row?</li>
<li>Should there be an <strong><em>explicit</em></strong> upper limit on the number of edits a user should be allowed to make in a day?</li>
<li>Should we set a higher bar for edits to closed questions?  </li>
<li>Perhaps we should require that edits to closed questions should actually address the problem that caused the question to be closed in the first place? (For example, correcting minor spelling or grammar problems in a question that was closed for being 'Too basic' probably doesn't add much value to the site)</li>
<li>Should we <strong>require</strong> that all new tags should be first discussed on meta?</li>

<p>The site already has a very good key word search. Making every keyword a tag has several detrimental effects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are too many to search. Tags are useful when there are few enough that one can scan them for  ways to further restrict a key word search.</p></li>
<li><p>There are too many to assign. If every keyword is a tag, what to do if a question has more than five key words? Should one prefer:</p>

<ul>
<li>century;</li>
<li>decade-of century;</li>
<li>current country name of geographic region;</li>
<li>contemporary country name;</li>
<li>political/military leader name;</li>
<li>political/military leader political philosophy;</li>
<li>political/military leader ethnicity;</li>
<li>city name;</li>
<li>province/district/region name, and then or now;</li>
<li>one of: military, war, battle, tactics, grand-tactics, strategy, siege, infantry, cavalry, artillery, submarine, frigate, naval, ships, ship-of-the-line, galley; quinquireme, trireme, brig, sloop, brigantine, bark, encirclement, advance, retreat, defense, ...</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>One could go on. There are as many potential keywords as there nouns, adjectives, place names, person names, and more in the English language.</p>

<p>So what makes a tag system useful? When the tags are the missing keywords. The keywords that describe the question but <strong><em>aren't</em></strong> in the text. They are useful only when they are in fact the <strong><em>anti-keywords</em></strong>, and few in number. Only then can the tag system provide a means of <strong><em>further restricting</em></strong> a keyword search based on meta-information about the question that doesn't appear in the question text - and might be expected to also not appear in the text of any answer.</p>

<p>Let's consider an example. When is a suitable usage of the tag <strong><em>napoleonic-wars</em></strong>? If the name of Napoleon appears in the question the tag is superfluous, but probably unavoidable. However if the question is about the Peninsular Campaign, or Russian Campaign, or one of the many distinguished (or not) commanders of the period, then the tag becomes a useful way to supplement a key word search - precisely because the question text doesn't contain the name of Napoleon, but is about the era of European history that he so dominated all discussion of. There are multiple Peninsular Campaigns inn history, so tagging one with <strong>napoleonic-wars</strong> and one with <strong>american-civil-war</strong> becomes useful - and double so when neither of those phrases is in the question text itself.</p>

<p>Likewise there are many well-known <em>Alexanders</em> in history. tagging a question about one with meta-data <strong>not</strong> in the question allows setting meta-data to distinguish Alexandre Berthier, Tsar Alexanders, Alexander Hamilton, Alexander the Great (and his era), etc. Only when tags are used in this way - and only in this way - is the Tag system even worth the effort.</p>

<p><strong><em>My view</em></strong> (with the usual caveat - <strong>please ignore any mod diamond you might see by my name</strong>), for what it's worth is that tags only add value to the site when used in this very limited way, or when they allow us to distinguish questions <em>about</em> a subject from those questions that simply <em>mention</em> that subject.</p>

<p>To (mis)quote Dr. Ian Malcolm: just because you <em>can</em> tag a question doesn't mean that you <em>should</em>.</p>

<hr>  

<p>Let me illustrate my point using the tags that were created (well before I joined the site) for the three main Allied leaders during the Second World War, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fdr"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;fdr&#39;"" rel=""tag"">fdr</a>, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stalin"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;stalin&#39;"" rel=""tag"">stalin</a>, and <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/churchill"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;churchill&#39;"" rel=""tag"">churchill</a>.</p>

<p>Given that our two most popular tags (by a large margin) are <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/united-states"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;united-states&#39;"" rel=""tag"">united-states</a> and <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/world-war-two"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;world-war-two&#39;"" rel=""tag"">world-war-two</a>, it does seem likely that we will get quite a lot of questions about American Presidents, and that the President who led the United States through the build up to the Second World War, and through most of the war itself, might be expected to get more than most.  </p>

<p>I'm guessing that was the reasoning behind the creation of the tag <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fdr"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;fdr&#39;"" rel=""tag"">fdr</a>.</p>

<p>A search for <code>fdr is:question</code> gives 24 results, while searching for <code>roosevelt is:question</code> gives 58.  Of course, the United States has had two presidents name 'Roosevelt', so in this case, the tag  <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fdr"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;fdr&#39;"" rel=""tag"">fdr</a> will - if used correctly - have the additional benefit of helping to distinguish questions <em>about</em> FDR from questions <em>about</em> Teddy Roosevelt.</p>

<p>In fact, right now, only 4 questions are tagged <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fdr"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;fdr&#39;"" rel=""tag"">fdr</a>.  </p>

<p>Looking at the lists produced by the searches above, there should almost certainly be more.  However, what is also clear from those search results is that many of the questions that <em>mention</em> FDR are not actually <em>about</em> FDR (for example <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/1024/24858"">What was the economic impact of WW1 on USA's economy?</a>), and so should absolutely <strong>not</strong> be tagged <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fdr"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;fdr&#39;"" rel=""tag"">fdr</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>In the case of <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stalin"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;stalin&#39;"" rel=""tag"">stalin</a>, the situation is slightly simpler.  It is unlikely that we will be getting too many questions about 'Fred Stalin from Cleethorpes', so the only purpose of the tag here is to distinguish between questions <em>about</em> Stalin and questions that just <em>mention</em> Stalin.</p>

<p>We currently have 50 questions that are tagged <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stalin"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;stalin&#39;"" rel=""tag"">stalin</a>, while a search for `stalin is:question' gives 151 results.  Clearly this tag is needed.  But it only has value if it is used consistently and correctly.  Looking at the lists, it seems this has not always been done.  </p>

<p>For example (<em>in my opinion</em>), the question <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/52145/24858"">Why did the rest of the Eastern Bloc not invade Yugoslavia?</a> has been tagged <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stalin"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;stalin&#39;"" rel=""tag"">stalin</a> when it should not have been, while <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/1707/24858"">Were there any attempts to assassinate Joseph Stalin?</a> has not been tagged <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stalin"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;stalin&#39;"" rel=""tag"">stalin</a> and it really should have been.</p>

<hr>

<p>Finally we come to <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/churchill"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;churchill&#39;"" rel=""tag"">churchill</a>.  </p>

<p>I couldn't find a meta post about the creation of this tag, and it was created before I joined, but my first question on seeing that tag would be ""<em>Is that Winston, Jack, or Sarah?</em>"" (in much the same way as, if we ever get enough questions to justify the creation of a tag for <em>Oliver Cromwell</em> (the <em>Lord Protector of England</em>), we name it in such a way as to avoid the possibility of confusion with <em>Thomas Cromwell</em>, or even <em>Richard Cromwell</em>).  </p>

<p>I think this illustrates the value in gaining input from the community before creating new tags.</p>

<p>We have 17 questions currently tagged <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/churchill"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;churchill&#39;"" rel=""tag"">churchill</a>, while a search for <code>churchill is:question</code> gives 72 results.  Once again, the tag does not appear to have been used consistently or correctly in all cases. The question <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/54550/24858"">Which peace offer did Hitler give to Great Britain in 1940?</a> has been tagged <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/churchill"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;churchill&#39;"" rel=""tag"">churchill</a>, and probably should not be.  On the other hand, the question  <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/53178/24858"">Is it true that Winston Churchill said 'I bet my head on Crete' (or a similar statement)?</a> is not tagged  <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/churchill"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;churchill&#39;"" rel=""tag"">churchill</a>, and it probably should be.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Now, I am not proposing a single massive re-tagging operation across all the questions and tags on the site.</strong>  That would be hugely disruptive.  But if people really want to improve tagging on the site, just correcting a few of these each day, to ensure that tags are only used where the question is <em>about</em> the topic of the tag, it could eventually give us a system of tags that is genuinely useful.</p>

<p>Of course, this highlights a good reason for what you have called ""<em>minimalism in tagging</em>"".  Fewer tags require less maintenance, and less maintenance means less disruption to the site.  The burden of that maintenance falls on the community as a whole, and the impact of that maintenance affects us all.</p>

<hr>

<p>To give just one further example.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4062/24858"">another meta question</a> you proposed the creation of the tag <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/east-india-company"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;east-india-company&#39;"" rel=""tag"">east-india-company</a> for the '<em>Honourable East India Company</em>' (HEIC).  A search for 'east india company is:question' currently gives 31 results, and a brief check of the list shows that many of those questions <em>mention</em> the company, but are not <em>about</em> the company (for example <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/39273/24858"">Why has Nepal never been conquered or colonized?</a>).  </p>

<p>Similarly, some of those questions are about the VoC (<em>Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie</em>, or '* Dutch East India Company*'), although probably not yet enough to justify creating their own tag (searching for <code>voc is:question</code> returned 3 questions, while searching `dutch east india company is:question' returned 5 questions.  Interestingly, only 2 of the questions from the first search appear in the second.  Those 2 are actually questions <em>about</em> the VoC, while the 3rd isn't).</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the HEIC also appears in answers to questions which don't themselves mention it.  An example here would be: <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/41771/24858"">What percentage of the British Empire's economy was profits from the opium trade?</a>.  (Clearly, this question isn't <em>about</em> the HEIC, and so shouldn't be tagged, if and when we do agree that the tag should be created.)  </p>

<p>The point here is that it is possible that an answer to a question will occasionally show that the question actually <em>was</em> about the tagged topic, even if the OP of the question didn't realise it, and the question didn't mention it.  In that case, it is probably appropriate to re-tag the question (ideally, perhaps, when posting the answer).  I did scroll through the list of answers and didn't see any in this case, but it is always worth checking.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, given all the above, <strong><em>in my opinion</em></strong>, it probably is worth creating a tag for the HEIC.  The value of the tag would be disambiguation between questions <em>about</em> the HEIC and questions that simply <em>mention</em> the HEIC.  However, we should be careful when choosing its name, and should also probably create relevant synonyms and an appropriate description for the tag at the same time.  </p>

<p>But, to be absolutely clear, <strong>that tag only has real value if it used solely for questions <em>about</em> the HEIC</strong>, and not just for any question that happens to <em>mention</em> the company.</p>

Surely all well-intentioned, but unfortunately inconsistent.</p>

<p>Therefore, <strong>this post seeks to develop and codify a standard practice going forward.</strong></p>

<p>Detailed tags are inherently useful. Unfortunately, (1) There's a limit of 5 tags per question, and (2) Inconsistent tagging resulting from lack of space harms the utility of the tagging system. We therefore need to strike a balance between specificity/detail, and pragmatism, that the community at large finds acceptable.</p>

<p>The primary questions that comes to mind are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Should WW2 questions be tagged by theatre?<br>
a. If so, what theatre tags do we need?<br>
b. Further, do theatre tagged questions require the WW2 general tag still?</li>
<li>Should we have country / regional tags on WW2 questions?<br>
a. If so, under what circumstances should country tags be assigned?<br>
b. Should we still use these if we want to use theatre tags?<br>
c. What about continental tags, such as <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/europe"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;europe&#39;"" rel=""tag"">europe</a> or <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/asia"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;asia&#39;"" rel=""tag"">asia</a>?</li>
<li>Should the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/war"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;war&#39;"" rel=""tag"">war</a> tag be used too?</li>

However, unless a specific academic methodology existed for this purpose (which I don't think it does), the answer sounds to me as if it would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Opinion-based;</li>
<li>Unverifiable;</li>
<li>Extremely dependent on what time period and area we were talking about.</li>
</ul>

<p>The alternative for this is to ask my question as, e.g., ""How far up the Gauja River could a Bremen trader sail in the early 13th century?"", but this, for me, is:</p>

<ul>

<li>Easy to miss if a similar question was to be investigated (e.g., if the next person was interested in the Niemen and not the Gauja);</li>
<li>For many places, extremely dependent on adequate primary sources to <em>prove</em> that the vessel had been that far upstream which could be data that simply is not in existence (if it ever was).</li>
</ul>

<p>I am unsure of the tightrope between these two extremes, although it could be that, e.g., ""How far upstream could a cog sail?"" would be the best version which would then have to be supported by either primary sources, the length/breadth of the cog, and its draft as well. Yet, this would also mean that we could have fifty questions on essentially the same issue (although, of course, it would make more sense to ask ""How far upstream the Nile could Thebans sail in the 20th dynasty?"" over a specific vessel type in that specific location...). </p>

Hence, the majority follow the line of thought as expressed by the idea behind ""monarchy"" quite well. The ones which don't, looking through the topics, are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Topics where ""kingdom"" is used in the sense of an ""independent principality"", but which don't actually need a monarch (or a 'king' as the 'monarch' can be a 'prince', 'duke', 'archduke', etc...) -- 4, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/10117/did-anyone-ever-win-a-kingdom-through-single-combat-without-a-backing-army-or-bl"">this</a>, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/34296/independent-persons-founding-personal-fiefdoms"">this</a>, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/30288/were-women-directly-involved-in-national-state-affairs-in-indian-kingdoms"">this</a>, and <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/14942/rulers-titles-in-middle-age-italy"">this</a>;</li>

",How can I make these four questions on topic?,4088,1,2,2020-05-11T21:31:08.223,CC BY-SA 4.0
,4088,,,,2020-05-11T22:19:38.227,24858,4,,2020-05-11T22:19:38.227,,,,,,"<p>OK, usual caveat:  <strong><em>What follows is my personal opinion.  Please ignore any moderator diamond you see after my name</em></strong></p>

<p>I did vote to close the first three questions as the ""5th vote"", so my moderator ""super-vote"" did not play a part, so I can at least explain why <em>I</em> voted to close in those cases.</p>

<hr>

<p>For the first question, I think that my comment there is actually the answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Probably because of the <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution</a>?  I doubt that filing for bankruptcy constitutes <em>probable cause</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, put another way, the FBI has to operate within the confines of the US Constitution.  I would say that fact is pretty 'basic' in this context, and something that really should have come up in your <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/261592/2085030"">prior research</a> before you posted the question here.  So I voted to close the question as ""Too basic"".  However, I decided to wait until four other users had voted to close before voting myself - mainly because I think closing questions should be a community decision wherever possible.</p>

<p>Now, if you don't understand <em>why</em> that answers your question, then I'd suggest that you should probably have asked for clarification when I posted the comment, or alternatively perhaps, asked <em>that</em> question on Law:SE.</p>

<hr>

<p>The second question  also seems to be answered by a comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There were Allied troops in much of Germany. Hard to fake that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That seems to be the obvious answer.  Large scale Allied armies, coupled with the destruction they frequently left in their wake, are indeed hard to fake. </p>

<p>Now, if you find that insufficient, then perhaps you need to edit your question to explain <em>why</em> you find the obvious answer yo be insufficient, and what more you are looking for.</p>

<hr>

<p>For your third question, as Rodrigo de Azevedo observed in a comment here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can one know the secrets that Marco Polo took to the grave?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More specifically, how would you know that any answer was correct?  Or equally, whether it was incorrect?  And, as our <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask"">Help Centre</a> states, you should:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""... avoid asking subjective questions where every answer is equally valid""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, don't ask questions where the answers are going to be based solely on users' opinions.  I really have no suggestions for how you could make this question on-topic.</p>

<hr>

<p>I didn't vote to close the last question, but I agree with the reason given by those who did.</p>

<p>The subsection of your question ""<em>Research on the origins of Sun Tzu and Art of War</em>"" clearly states the problem inherent in your question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""...  the origins of the work that are shrouded in mystery. The author may or may not be historical; the manuscript tradition is fraught with difficulties; the text itself was summarized by Robin Yates as ""terse and obscure"" and by Victor Mair as ""extraordinarily terse and maddeningly obscure"".""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of which raises the (to me) obvious question, if we don't know the <em>origins</em> of the work, how can we possibly answer <em>how</em> it was widely circulated (never mind  <em>why</em>), other than with opinions?  </p>

<p>So once again (imo), we have a question where every answer (within reason) is equally valid, and, as stated above, questions like that are generally not considered to be a good fit with SE.</p>

Thank you for raising the question in meta - the only way we can examine our culture and make it more welcoming, and more effective in generating the site we want is to explicitly discuss these questions in meta.</p>

<p>What follows are my personal opinions &amp; observations; as my colleague says, please ignore the diamond. I'm only offering these because you asked, and I hope in the spirit of welcome. To the best of my memory, I did not cast a close vote on any of the questions. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why didn't the FBI monitor bankrupt (former) employees more watchfully? contains the phrase,  ""Wasn't it obvious . . . "" , which suggests to me that you're looking for a discussion, not for an answer.   You've got enough research in the question to indicate that you've thought about it and done work, but you've chosen not to examine this assumption.  I could be completely wrong - I'm just providing feedback on how the question struck me. </p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/59155/1401"">How long did it take Jews in hiding</a>; contains no preliminary research.  </p></li>
<li><p>Marco Polo said on his deathbed, ""I did not tell half of what I saw, for I knew I would not be believed."" What didn't he disclose? Why? "" - my first reaction was ""How could we know?"" my second reaction was ""Even if there were an answer, how would we tell if it was a total fabrication""  My third reaction was, ""This is further evidence that Marco Polo was willing to subvert even his death in the service of his own ego."" At that point I classified the question as ""this isn't interesting"", and only skimmed the rest.  I will admit that I was impressed by the research you did to try to form the question, but it Marco Polo's questionable relationship with the truth, and the dim prospect of an authoritative answer left me with the desire to move on. </p></li>
<li><p>Sun Tzu - I skimmed this because I lack the scholarship to engage; the premise of the question seemed to be a false dichotomy - I can imagine several reasons to write the Art of War, and it seems to me that <em>if</em> I were a scholar of that period/area, it would be relatively easy to construct and test hypothesis. ( I should note in passing that there are several of us on the stack who would like to see more non-Western history questions; I just didn't find this one compelling).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>One other observation - several of these questions generated long comment strings - which is a signal of a question that is in trouble. Another anti-pattern that isn't obvious - you participated in the discussion.  When the original poster replies in comments, that generally indicates a desire for discussion/debate/argument, and is correlated with question closure.  The better pattern is to update the question to address the issues raised in comments. </p>

<p>We are a difficult stack exchange.  History is a science, and we expect much of the same rigor and discipline from our questions that you would expect from a hard science/coding stack exchange. Many people come here and get tripped up by gaps in cultural expectations. I wish that I knew a way to thread the gap between welcoming new members with new topics and new interests on the one hand, and on the other hand preserving</p>

<p>I dashed this off quickly, sharing impressions - none of them should reflect on you personally; they are just subjective impressions, not finished judgments. I felt that if you had gone to the trouble of raising the question in meta, I owed you the courtesy of a response. </p>

<p>I don't propose to go through every example from your list of linked questions, but this is a representative example, from the first question in your list.</p>

<hr>

<p>In the section that you have titled ""<strong><em>My research on Poe's military history</em></strong>"", you say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those with military inclinations, like Poe himself, could find their place within local militia regiments. Poe, then 15, joined up with a local honor guard that formed and marched in the parade that welcomed Lafeyette to his home town in 1824. Local militias were meant to be reflections of the local reputation network, and tended to have ""elites"" - either men with money and means, or men with experience - elected as leaders, with the rest working to gain military (as well as social) skills for the betterment of their community, as opposed to the army, which was so easy to be misused for the benefit of a few alienated politicians. These were, at least, the ideals, but the model of the interested local militia and the aloof, mercenary regular army was breaking down even by the early 1820s...</p>

<p>This passage is from the <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/cpzbnd/at_age_18_edgar_allan_poe_joined_the_us_army_in/ewuny2p?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">answer</a> posted by the user <em>PartyMoses</em> to the question <em>At age 18, Edgar Allan Poe joined the US Army in 1827 as a Private, and left in 1829 as a Sergeant Major of Artillery. How did he attain the highest enlisted rank in just two years?</em> on Reddit AskHistorians (posted 9 months ago):</p>

<blockquote>

These cases seem to be treated (even if by the people themselves) differently at source -- some consider it acceptable, others not. </p>

<p>An example can be found <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/57248/16201"">here</a> where one of the comments refers to material in Catalan which answers the question but the answer wasn't posted because the material is not in English; an alternative can be found <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/59087/16201"">here where I answered using source material in French with Google Translate translations</a>  (though which didn't seem too far off the mark).</p>

<hr>

<p>Question: <strong>Should an explicit policy on using translated source material in answers be described, and, if so, what should it be?</strong> </p>

<hr>

<p>My Answer: </p>

<p>As Anglosphere historians necessarily focus more on English, American, Canadian, etc, English-derived histories (or, in other words, what sells in modern Anglophone countries; see example below for mentions of 'Teutonic Order' in English texts vs 'Deutschen Ordens' in German texts, but of course Greece and Rome are also very popular in English popular narrative histories), it can be impossible to find an English source of the same quality as a local one. <strong>Therefore, to answer questions relating to other places in similar detail, I think allowing translated source material is essential and should be explicitly allowed.</strong> </p>

<p>However, we should also be careful about the level of translations and want these to be sourced (e.g., ""Google"" vs ""personal"" vs ""official"", etc...) and to allow these to be improved over time. Also, in all of these cases we should preserve both the original as well as the translation, so both versions can be looked at by people interested in the questions (and the translation improved where mistakes are spotted).</p>

Preferably with paragraph breaks, not a big wall of text. </p>

<p>So to the main question, how to handle a chunk of referenced source text that is in a language other than English?</p>

<p>I'll list the options in descending order of preference:</p>

<ol>
<li>Quoted block, followed by well-translated English block
This seems to work best in the form:</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Original non-English text</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which translates to (list translation source):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>English translation of original non-English text</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>As above, but the translation is your own, and you're pretty sure its an imperfect job. In this case, don't be afraid to note that fact, and ask for help with whichever end (English or source language) you are unsure of. Our users can help you edit it into shape, if it is at least good enough to be understandable. (There are few things people on the internet love to do more than correct others on little details)</li>
<li>You don't think you could do a readable job of translating. The text contains a reference to the original source, along with your English description or paraphrase of what it says. Just like you'd do with any other source that you don't want to include verbatim.</li>
<li>You don't think you could do a readable job of translating, but you <em>really</em> want to show the specific context under discussion. In this case, provide the original quote, and then follow with a paraphrase of what it says in English.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you think an automated translator can get you up to level 2 above, do it (and reference the translator you used). However, in my experience Google translate does a dumb word-for-word vocabulary translation, with a result that is simply not up to par. Its worse (often much worse, and sometimes <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHKKolizGuo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hilariously worse</a>) than just a paraphrasing.</p>

We should not become the site of experts where the poster cannot formulate a good question unless edited by us.</p>

<p>My main concern is that while the theater designations are correct, they don't come naturally to people asking the questions. They know it's the second world war and Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union, and they have a question about that, so that is how they will tag it. </p>

<p>The theater tags are nice and probably correct but should always be <em>in addition</em> to the tags naturally used and understood by the poster. They should never replace them or remove one of the tags that the user is familiar with.</p>

<hr>

<p>so to go through the list of questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should WW2 questions be tagged by theatre</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only if there is enough room to fit in the tag without removing others or if the question is actually about the whole theatre.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should we have country / regional tags on WW2 questions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely. Why not? If I want to know about dutch coastal bunkers in 1943, I would tag it World War 2 and Dutch and maybe I find a tag for coastal defense. I don't know how a european theatre tag would help.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/war"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;war&#39;"" rel=""tag"">war</a> tag be used too?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think using the world war two tag <em>and</em> the war tag would be redundant. If both are used, the war tag can be removed, if just the war tag is used it can be replaced by the correct war tag. World War 2 is a big enough thing that people know the designation without being an expert.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under what circumstances should the sino-japanese-war tag coexist with the WW2 tags?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess when someone actually has a question about it? I'm not that much of a history expert, but I guess in 1937 there was no World War 2 yet, so it would apply. But again, if someone tagged a question WW2 and Japan and China, I think that's sufficient. If the additional tag fits in, great. Otherwise, do not remove their common sense tags and replace them with specifics probably unknown to them.</p>

<p>A critic wrote: ""Your alleged etymology <strong>is wholly unsupported both by Wikipedia</strong> and Webster's."" {Emphasis added.]</p>

<p>That was untrue, and I cited the relevant line: ""Author Todd DePastino has suggested it may be derived from the term hoe-boy."" </p>

<p>Then the commenter wrote: ""The fanciful inventions of one author, 150 years after the fact and without any attestations in literature, are not support no matter how much you would like the hypothesis to be true. For all you know Postino (sic!) wrote that into the Wiki article himself to publicize his book.""</p>

<p>The above exchange strikes me as overly skeptical. Certainly, we should take with  grain of salt anything we read on Wikipedia (or elsewhere). But I double checked <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_DePastino"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">de Pastino's background.</a> He has a PhD from an Ivy League school, has won a literary prize, has multiple publications, and is a professor at a pretty good school (Penn State). Certainly there was nothing to suggest to me that he ""wrote that into the Wiki article himself to publicize his book."" I'm pretty sure that Wikipedia has controls to guard against such conflicts of interest.</p>

<p>Members of other SE sites have noted: ""Wikipedia is your friend."" While I wouldn't go that far, I do consider it a source of ""ground level"" due diligence.</p>

Instead, they are fundamentally sophisticated, which is why you need to take extra care to explain exactly what you are asking. This, in turn requires both understanding and articulation of the key points of your questions.</p>

<p>In the ""Jews"" question, a ""trivial"" response was that it was safe for them to reveal themselves when the Allied troops arrived. As it turns out, the issue was more complicated than that because the Germans used subterfuge to thwart Allied controls. But you would do best to state the general rule that hat it was safe for them to reveal themselves when the Allied troops arrived, and then ask for exceptions to the rule.</p>

<p>In the Sun Tzu question, it depends e.g. one whether ""the Art of War"" was produced at one time and place, or over a long time and multiple locations, possibly by multiple people. If it was the first, one writer in one year for one king, then it's logical to assume that the king wanted to keep this knowledge for himself. The other possibility was that it was ""compiled"" over many years, possibly in multiple locations, and by various authors. Given its dissemination, the latter is more likely, but you should address both of these scenarios and then ask under what conditions the ""Art of War"" was produced. </p>

<p>Likewise, in your FBI question, you should ask about ""standard"" FBI procedure and then for a comparison of how the FBI maintained surveillance on Ronald Pelton compared to others (e.g. Jonathan Pollard). In another question about English constitutional assemblies, I referred you to the French example for comparison. You appeared not to understand, meaning that you had no basis for comparison.  You don't need to know ""everything"" about a particular topic, but you need to know ""something"" so that you are not starting from ground zero.</p>

<p>It has occurred to me that you do not always fully understand the questions that you are asking. You do seem to have a ""nose"" for interesting issues, but you rely heavily on outside sources to articulate these issues. For some of your questions, you should wait until you have a better grasp of the underlying issues before asking about them.</p>

There have been several studies published on the reliability (or otherwise) of Wikipedia. I listed a few in <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3709/24858"">my answer</a> to a related question here, but I have no doubt that a quick Google search will find plenty of others (other search engines are available).</p>

<p>However, just as with any popular reference source, you should always check the citations where possible.</p>

<hr>

<p>In this case, the person posting the comment was correct when they said that your suggested etymology isn't supported by Wikipedia.  What the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobo#Etymology"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> actually states is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The origin of the term is unknown. According to etymologist Anatoly Liberman, the only certain detail about its origin is the word was first noticed in American English circa 1890.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>citing Anatoly Liberman's article, <em><a href=""https://blog.oup.com/2008/11/hobo/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">On Hobos, Hautboys, and Other Beaus</a></em> on the OUP Blog as its source.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, you are correct that the Etymology section of the Wikipedia article goes on to observe that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Author Todd DePastino has suggested it may be derived from the term hoe-boy meaning ""farmhand"", or a greeting such as Ho, boy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This time the cited source was <a href=""https://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/143783in.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">An interview with Todd DePastino, author of <em>Citizen Hobo: How a Century of Homelessness Shaped America</em></a>.  The interview is published on the University of Chicago Press website.  </p>

<p>In the interview, DePastino said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where did the word ""hobo"" come from? I've not found a convincing explanation. Some say it derives from the term ""hoe-boy,"" meaning farm hand, or ""homo bonus,"" meaning ""good man."" Others speculate that men shouted ""Ho, Boy!"" to each other on the road. One particularly literate wayfarer insisted the term came from the French ""haut beau."" Whatever its origin, the word ""hobo"" became widespread in American vernacular during yet another major depression from 1893 to 1897.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, was the Wikipedia editor right to say that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""... Todd DePastino has suggested it may be derived from the term hoe-boy ...""?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, perhaps.  But in that case, the emphasis in that sentence should be heavily on ""<em>may</em>"" and it really is stretching the point.  </p>

<p>Personally, I would say it is certainly <em>not</em> an accurate representation of what DePastino actually said.</p>

<p>It would probably be more accurate to state something like:</p>

<p>""<em>Author Todd DePastino notes that some have said that it derives from the term ""hoe-boy"", meaning ""farmhand"", or a greeting such as ""Ho, boy"", but that he does not find these to be convincing explanations</em>"".</p>

<p>Leaving the citation link to the interview unchanged. (If anyone feels inclined to improve Wikipedia at this stage, feel free to use that text).</p>

<hr>

<p>The point here is that - as with any popular reference source - the reliability of Wikipedia depends both on the accuracy of the sources cited, and the skills of the editors who collaborate to produce the articles.</p>

<p>In this case, had you checked the cited source, you might not have been quite so emphatic when you defined 'hobo' in your answer.  </p>

<p>Equally, had the commenter taken a moment to check the source, they might not have been quite so quick to cast aspersions on Todd DePastino's academic reputation.</p>

This would be more useful for the UK where -- perhaps half? -- of questions relating to Winston Churchill might actually involve things executed by Attlee or Halifax.</p>
<hr />
<p>On the question of East India Companies, I don't think there should be a tag for the British East India Company over the Dutch (or any other) one. There should be a uniform one that applies to all <em>chartered trading companies</em> (as in the topic in question) such that they are all grouped together -- hence, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chartered-companies"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;chartered-companies&#39;"" rel=""tag"">chartered-companies</a> works very well. <strong>This makes sense because if someone is on the tag watch, they can subscribe and see questions on the Portuguese, the Dutch, and the British.</strong> Also, companies which engaged in trade on the same principles in Canada and the US should be included -- the HBC doesn't need its own tag, etc, because it would be too low-use while not offering a significant contribution.</p>
<p>Yet, the person interested in the HEIC/VOIC is also likely to be interested in the operation of the HBC, if not due to the time and location, but due to the nature of the development of a commercial company and how its rights progressed. If this doesn't stem to &quot;interest&quot; (maybe they got taken around a few too many malls as a child), I think it still indicates a useful link to topics that the person would have knowledge of. <strong>This should also lead to answers with that were perhaps not intended, but which are better for referencing <em>other similar entities</em> and increasing our understanding of how the entire system worked by bringing the question to the attention of the experts in that field.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>It was on similar principles that <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4087/16201"">I previously said</a> that a <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/christian-military-orders"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;christian-military-orders&#39;"" rel=""tag"">christian-military-orders</a> should exist to cover Calatrava, Sword Brethern, etc. I think I was a bit mistaken in that because it would actually make sense to use this general tag for the Templars, Hospitallers, Germans, Calatrava, and everyone else. Same boot. Once we have 25 or more (arbitrary number this '25') questions on an Order also give that a separate tag, to be used alongside. So, in this case, we would have one type-tag (much like <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/trade"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;trade&#39;"" rel=""tag"">trade</a> or <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/diplomacy"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;diplomacy&#39;"" rel=""tag"">diplomacy</a>) which people could subscribe to in order to learn about the feature, along with more specialized country-tags (what they were in effect) to focus on those.</p>
<hr />
<p>With regards to tags being specified on questions which don't belong there, much like what sempaiscuba described above, there should be a slow but steady cull. The only way this can work, however, is if the tags have a description to describe what they should be for. Even if the name of the tag seems to fit, the purpose behind that tag can only be described by the tag wiki.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we should strive to remove (please note this is quite different from the very separate and far more difficult question of 'When should other suitable tags be added to a question?') the unsuitable tags from questions when these are apparent (say the examples from above where <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fdr"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;fdr&#39;"" rel=""tag"">fdr</a> is used for things that don't relate to FDR).</p>
<hr />
<p>I didn't mean the notes above on <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/fdr"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;fdr&#39;"" rel=""tag"">fdr</a>, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stalin"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;stalin&#39;"" rel=""tag"">stalin</a>, etc as actual propositions that those should be deleted. I was merely indicating the way that I <em>think</em> tagging should work: a method of categorization to help people subscribe to topics they like and to find questions they might know about. Obviously cases will extend outside of this and that doesn't mean that other more specific ones might not be necessary: perhaps the same <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/stalin"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;stalin&#39;"" rel=""tag"">stalin</a> being a case in point.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, as the study of history is generally focussed in time and space -- not many people studying the entire history of everywhere -- all questions should be placed into a geographical location and time from the tags associated with that question.</strong></p>

<p>Tag-edits as tag-only-edits/re-tag-only-edits (tag edit also means 'editing the tag/tag-info/tag-wiki):</p>

<p>To me, they are always acceptable — if they concern <em>just one question</em> that <em>really benefits</em> from a re-tag. A list of caveats applies, see below.</p>

<p>If a question benefits from improvement, then edit.<br>
If you want to improve <em>a</em> question with a re-tag, then do it.</p>

<p><strong><em>BUT:</em></strong> There are limits to this reasoning and thus limits to when one should edit a question in that way. Many good and correct tags to make that system work as best as possible is a quite desirable ideal, how we arrive at that in practice a road full of thorny details.</p>

<p>The above assumes a few priors that are not always easy to ascertain properly.</p>

<p>Most important of these: that the tag system itself is seen as useful, properly maintained and applied most of the time, and that usually most tags should be applied so obviously correct that there should be near instant near universal agreement on them and how they are applied to a question.</p>

<p>The above could be applied to systematic changes on how we improve our tag system. Like when new tags are introduced that should be applied retroactively to old questions as needed. That was done before (<a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3908"">example</a>), and we will likely run into this in the future. The goal should be a consistent and thus predictable way tags work and are applied. Meaning in my book: all questions should get all the tags they need as best fitting as possible, the limit is system-imposed at five tags maximum.</p>

<p>The caveats for the re-tag-only-edits:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do not limit yourself to re-tag-only-edit on any given post, but:
A re-tag-only is always 'a minor edit' – which <em>we should try to avoid</em> when possible: if there is anything else that could be improved: spelling, grammar, formatting, links, references, etc. — try to improve that as well. In short: avoid tag-only-edits in favour of comprehensive edits if at all possible. As a shorthand for this spectrum of tag-edits from 'tag-only-edit' to 're-tag and renovation/comprehensive edit' I'll use 'tag-inspired-edits' (TIES) here</li>
<li>Do limit yourself to how many TIES you want to present to the active-tab/'homepage' for any given day. 'One' seems fine to me in any case, three to five will not cause much upset, but anything above that limit <em>will</em> make my eyebrows go up, and some users here even get quite mad about this and see that as an abusive behaviour.</li>
<li>This rule of thumb comes in two subspecies: 1. 'suggested edits' by low-rep users, needing review from OP, or two user reviewers or a mod review. Too much of these in a row (especially when from one single user) clog the queues and shall be avoided. 2. Hi-rep users getting carried away in 'editing frenzies': avoids the review <em>queue</em>, but still needs review for correctness by users. — Both casses done in excess flood the active-tab and both are undesirable. (Once I notice a pattern of the same user doing mainly minor edits, I tend to loose interest in these bumped posts altogether — that is at least for the content of that post. Instead a teacher-mode might awake and the goal is no longer reading the post as such but monitor and control those actions… or: not what I'm here for really)</li>
<li>Do limit yourself especially when creating a new tag. It may be a very useful addition, but by now it's probably best to ask about creating it on Meta_H:SE first?</li>
<li>Take care to look at a few special characteristics of a post:<br>
like: close-status <em>and</em> close-date:
Closed questions usually need improvements (if not closed falsely/for the wrong reasons, or community disagreement). A minor edit like TIES is highly unlikely to be enough improvement to warrant a re-open. But even this minor edit will automatically put the post into the re-open-review-queue. Which in turn will lead to quite a few reviewers vote to 'leave-closed' for lack of necessary improvement. This actively sabotages the OP, the post and the reviewers of that queue.<br>
--> Avoid TIES / other minor edits <em>strictly</em> on questions closed less than 7 days ago if they aren't highly active currently anyway (which most often will imply that they are or were in that queue anyway). </li>

<p>For example, if we don't have any commentaries on the texts, we cannot evaluate their development. </p>

<p>Similarly, if your question is say why a version of Gilgamesh was modified in newer version then that might be difficult to answer without bringing our own opinions in -- unless the new scribe also put down why they modified the text, but the latter should be verifiable, i.e., ""Did the scribe reason why they modified Gilgamesh's text from the previous version in the 10th century BC?"" as opposed to ""Why was the text of Gilgamesh changed over time?"".</p>

<p>But, at the same time if the question were to ask ""How did contemporary clerics assess the scripture of King James' Bible?"" or something along those lines, then I don't see a problem with that -- given there would be an answer that we could research in existence which would be solely focused on the historical development of that text, potentially including the clerics' understanding of the motivations of that text as well.</p>

<p>This is similar to another answer, but tweaks the wording to sound less like an accusation.</p>

<p><em>In particular, if you immediately and directly ask the OP to edit/revise their question, especially to make it better fit community standards, it sounds like you're saying that the question has a problem in its current form.</em></p>

<p>By removing the direct request, we avoid making it sound like an accusation.  Further reinforcement in this case is provided through phrases such as, ""As just a standard notice that we give out to all newcomers...""</p>

<p>Here we <em>do</em> make the OP aware of the issue if there is one, but we don't come across strong or unfriendly when everything is already fine as-is.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> It took me by surprise, but there seems to be some disagreement within the community about whether we just post the message on newcomer questions which have shown obvious problems, or whether we just copy and paste it on all newcomer questions.  Personally I would've imagined the intention to be the former.  However the disagreement does appear to be there, and so my version of the text <em>is only applicable in the latter case</em>, where we're just telling this to all the newcomers.</p>

<p>Originally this came up because I saw a version of this that sounded like an accusation posted on somebody else's question, when the question clearly showed research.  In the comments below, there has been disagreement with some of what the OP was saying, but the fact is that they clearly did research, even if they had might've misunderstood something about it.  <em>That's what questions are for.</em>  In either case, whether we just post a message on problematic posts or on all new comer questions, <em>the point is that we shouldn't be accusing the OP of not doing their homework when it's clear they have</em>, whether they misunderstood something or not.</p>

<p>A question having more tags is more searchable. Tagging is free; the limit of five encourages us to focus on the most significant ones. Tags are not mirrors onto the textual content of questions and cannot be equated to the appearance of a certain term in free text. Rather, they are editorial statements made in a structured form. As all our questions pertain to various named entities, and we want our tags to describe questions well, leaving tags off of them is a missed opportunity.</p>

<p>Tags that are more precise are richer in value because they are more distinctive. Happily, this site allows ranking users to create tags without prior discussion, which is the folksonomic approach also used on Wikipedia. Minor work on the taxonomy is undertaken by individual initiative, and major work by consensus. Editorial effort to change a question's tags or to combine two tags can support consistency and coherence; casting judgment on the usefulness of a tag's existence does not.</p>

<p>The inherent tension in information retrieval is a balance between precision (the fraction of documents returned which are relevant) and recall (the fraction of all the relevant documents which were returned). More precise search terms may have to be linked with a Boolean OR, while more vague search terms result in wading through pages of irrelevant results.</p>

<p>As a thought experiment, consider the difference in magnitude of the tag information between a question with two tags from of a vocabulary of ten terms, and a question with four tags from a vocabulary of ten thousand terms. Using a fixed-width encoding the former occupies 2*log2(10) bits and the latter, 4*log2(10000) bits; the second set of tags expresses eight times as much information as the first.</p>

<p>The most obvious calls would be regions that spent time as their own separate independent countries with interesting histories during that period. <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hawaii"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;hawaii&#39;"" rel=""tag"">hawaii</a>, <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/scotland"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;scotland&#39;"" rel=""tag"">scotland</a>, and <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/texas"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;texas&#39;"" rel=""tag"">texas</a> certainly seem valid, and I think <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/england"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;england&#39;"" rel=""tag"">england</a> is beyond reproach.</p>

<p>From a cultural heft point of view it makes sense to have a <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/new-york"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;new-york&#39;"" rel=""tag"">new-york</a> (for a while the largest city in the world), a <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/northern-ireland"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;northern-ireland&#39;"" rel=""tag"">northern-ireland</a> (a lot of history has happened there), and arguably a <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/california"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;california&#39;"" rel=""tag"">california</a> (Population slightly larger than Poland. 5th largest economy in the world, if it were its own country).</p>

<p>On very shaky ground are regions who's only real claim to international historical fame is having changed owners one or more times. In this category I'd put <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/alaska"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;alaska&#39;"" rel=""tag"">alaska</a> and <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/florida"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;florida&#39;"" rel=""tag"">florida</a>.

<hr>

<p>Presumably then, the questions you are referring to were asked with a different account (or perhaps accounts)? If that is the case, the question becomes <strong><em>has that account (or have those accounts) previously been subject to sanctions by any site on the SE network?</em></strong></p>

<p>You say that your questions are ""<strong><em>frequently</em></strong>"" closed elsewhere on SE (although this will not have been ""for no reason"", as you claim.

<p>[This is only speculation on my part: moderators are (quite rightly) not privy to the details of any systems like that.  However the existence of such systems seems probable to me].</p>

<p>The solution here would appear to be straightforward.  Just register your account and post your questions from that account.  That way, you will receive the reputation from well-asked, on-topic, questions.  </p>

<p>If you cannot do this for some reason (for example because you are suspended or banned from the SE network), then you will probably have to either wait until you are able to (e.g. when your suspension ends), or find somewhere else to ask your questions.</p>

<p>From what I understand, some limited reference requests are OK, but what about other proposals (such as selected lists, CW, chatroom): Did we try to implement these but it did not work? </p>

<p>I understand why we have a policy against general reference requests, but I do not feel good about just closing such questions: Where should people ask if not here? Answering in comments is not right either. Telling people to read Wikipedia articles is not right as well, since the number of references there can be overwhelming and most are irrelevant for a newbie.</p>

<p>Since, I assume, the other proposed ideas did not work, did we try channeling reference requests to Meta-HSE? Of course, Meta is not meant for this, but answering on Meta would resolve at least some issues related to reference requests (such as gaining reputation by posting trivial answers, or attracting low quality answers). Unlike chatrooms, Meta is easily searchable; Meta-votes mean something quite different from votes on main; Meta-questions need not admit definitive answers: disagreement on Meta  is common (by design). </p>

<p>OK, now to the question of  why am I reopening the old issue which was discussed at length before:   </p>

<ol>
<li><p>I am very hesitant reviving at once many old threads (primarily items in b and c lists), but curious to find out what (if anything) happened. </p></li>
<li><p>The meta-based proposal for reference lists appears to be new (but I might have easily missed something).  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Lastly: It is quite possible that nothing can be done regarding reference requests since people most active on this site are too busy or/and tired of discussing this issue, or mostly are opposed to reference requests of any type. That would be a fine answer as well. </p>

<p><strong>Edit.</strong> To answer mod's question asked in a comment to one of the answers:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong>  I am active on three other stackexchange sites: Mathoverflow (MO), Math.stackexchange (MSE) and History of Science and Mathematics (HSM). All three allow for reference requests; to give few examples from HSM (since it is closer to HSE): </p>

<p>a. ""<a href=""https://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/7957/what-are-some-good-references-elucidating-the-discovery-creation-of-fourier-seri"">What are some good references elucidating the discovery/creation of Fourier Series?</a>""</p>

<p>b.  <a href=""https://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/11769/literature-on-mayan-mathematics"">""Literature on Mayan mathematics""</a>. </p>

<p>c. <a href=""https://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/654/request-for-good-resources-on-history-of-infinity-topics"">""Request for good resources on 'history of infinity' topics""</a>. </p>

<p>d. <a href=""https://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/2380/books-on-the-history-of-physics"">""Books on the History of Physics""</a>: I think this request was not shot down because the body of the question made it clear that the questioner was primarily interested in  history of Quantum Mechanics. </p>

<p>e. But this reference request was too broad and closed for that reason:</p>

<p><a href=""https://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/8497/what-are-some-good-books-on-history-of-mathematical-thought"">What are some good books on history of mathematical thought?</a>. </p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Two more stack exchange sites I am familiar with (but not active at): matheducators and physics. </p>

<p><strong>(i)</strong> Matheducators allow for very broadly-stated reference requests such as:</p>

<p><a href=""https://matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/294/what-are-some-great-books-for-exploring-mathematics-not-kids-books-and-not-te"">What are some great books for exploring mathematics? (not kids' books and not textbooks)</a>. It was well-received and had many answers. </p>

<p><strong>(ii)</strong> The current situation on physics stack exchange is less clear, but they created (via CW) a large list of book references for variety of topics in physics, 
<a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/12175/book-recommendations"">Book recommendations [closed]</a>, with the preamble:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every once in a while, we get a question asking for a book or other educational reference on a particular topic at a particular level. This is a meta-question that collects all those links together. If you're looking for book recommendations, this is probably the place to start.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>However, of course, each stackexchange site has its own culture regarding what questions are acceptable. </p>

<p>Edit. So far, looking at the votes, it appears that there is nothing close to a solid majority agreement on anything regarding references (the split is about 50-50). But maybe the sample is too small.</p>

With regards to secondary sources, the main complicating factor is the difficulty that we have in assessing the answer (much as has been written before). Therefore, the question, as also indicated in the past, relates to ""how"" these requests can be made acceptable in the SE format.</p>

<p>I would be very interested in seeing answers relating to secondary sources as it would no doubt enhance our perspective. Quite possibly, a good answer along the lines I've brought out below will force us to be better and more thorough in our own future reading which is <em>always</em> a good thing.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Policy</h2>

<p>I think the policy should work along the lines that <strong>when we propose a book we should also make the case—the biggest possible case—against that book. We should also include and link to reviews in reputable sources if such are available—and we can even comment on these reviews!</strong> </p>

<hr>

<h2>Answers</h2>

<p>Every author has their strengths as well as weaknesses; for someone to be able to determine if that answer suits their question (let's get to that later) the answer should highlight those weaknesses and try to give an objective measure of that author. Hence, answers should be of the type:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gibbon's 'Decline and Fall' is outdated [reference], exhibits bias against the Greeks [reference], misses out on important recent developments on historiography [reference &amp; examples] but is eminently readable and still provides a good understanding of the <em>general trends</em> if the reader can compensate for the above weaknesses.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Weir's biography of Isabella the Fair is weak, because the majority of evidence is inconclusive, the author indulges in frequent hyperbole to make a case, relevant research or proof is rarely brought, most statements are obvious conjecture (""We may have to assume...""/""It is likely that...""). Nevertheless, the author has brought together all the material that is relevant to Isabella which is presently available. Even if the book is poor, it is a notch above previous volumes that consider the topic, and the female perspective from the author is a considerable improvement over previous Victorian historians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the same time, an answer along the lines of the below would be unacceptable:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Read Gibbon because he's the classical source on Rome who constructed the theories that are being used today.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Weir's 'Isabella the Fair' is good because it's written by a woman.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The references that we bring could either be external or specific citations from the book that can be refuted easily. Hence, if an author was a Holocaust-denier, it would be quite easy to <em>reveal</em> that fact.</p>

<p><em>Caveat:</em> Admittedly, however, I am far happier with source requests that concern Medieval England or Ancient Carthage as I also try (and fail) to stay away from the WW2 and more recent topics (or for even more recent things, they might be <em>too</em> recent). It is clear that there's plenty of controversy that some groups knowingly try to create about this time; therefore, it might make sense to have a list of 'hot' topics which would cause any answers to be 'community wiki' and subject to harsher requirements.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>This also moves some onus to the questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/59703/what-is-a-good-book-about-the-history-of-england"">What is a good book about the history of England?</a> is eminently unanswerable, because:

<ol>
<li>There is no criterion on what makes a book ""good"".</li>
<li>""History of England"" is very broad.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>Nevertheless, a charitable reading can <em>always</em> get past the first part. Especially given <em>canonical</em> resources are already allowed, we should read the above question as:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the canonical resource on the history of England?</li>
</ul>

<p>We can always direct the poster to why we are making an edit along these lines for this specific point. Of course, the same difficulty arises in assessing what makes a resource canonical and therefore I'd treat all book answers as I've described mine above. </p>

<p>We are left, at this point, with issue <strong>#2</strong>. This is still unsolvable and this is something we should enquire about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the OP interested in:

<ol>
<li>Political history;</li>
<li>Military history;</li>
<li>Economic history;</li>
<li>Cultural history.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>This would enable to pick a more specific volume that would fit the OP's request as well as create a topic that others could refer to for similar questions.</p>

<hr>

<p>There is one alternative to generic history questions which would entail a more community-based solution. Namely, we could also find that the question ""What is the canonical resource on the history of a country?"" would <strong>always</strong> be answered by the same publisher's books (e.g., Oxford's 'History of X'). The potential downside for this is the advertising factor this would entail and while this sounded a better idea to me previously, that a book is released by Oxford or Cambridge doesn't mean we shouldn't read it with a critical eye.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two different types of “Sabeans”. The first is the Soba descended from Ham that are native to Sudan which the Persians later conquered and changed to Meroe. And there is the Saba of Yemen who is an Arab man that had 10 children; 4 of which went to Syria and 6 of which stayed in Yemen; and they all formed major tribes. I’ll call the first Sobas and the second Sabeans.</p>
  
  <p>Now, if you discard the spoonfed brainwash that the traditional institutions and academia teach you and embark on some researching using The Holy Quran, The Narrations of Prophet Muhammad (PPBUH), The Bible, some dictionaries, the internet/encyclopedia/history books, and just common sense you would realize that Ethiopia is the land of Canaan that later became the holy land of Israel-Judah. It is purely Divine Will to have it hidden from the masses, so it’s okay if you don’t buy it; but it is the truth. With that said, here are the answers to your questions:</p>
  
  <p>I want to know if the Sabean people truly existed (archaeological evidence)
  Soba in Sudan - Look up Meroe Saba in Yemen - Too much left behind there. The Musnad and Zabur script are attributed to them, and a theory suggests that the Zabur script, which was developed by them as a cursive form of the Musnad script, was the foundation of the Syriac script; you can actually see it just by looking at the pictures. After the Mar’ib Dam collapsed many Sabeans migrated to Syria and mixed with the Assyrians there, and in due time they developed the Syriac script by mixing the Aramaic and the Zabur, and this script was fully functional by the first century AD. Many scholars claim the Peshitta Bible was the origin of scriptures because it was written in Syriac, and some linguists say the Arabic script was developed from the Syriac as well.</p>
  
  <p>Where are their descendants today?
  Soba - In Africa &amp; other places. Saba - In Yemen, Ethiopia, Syria, Iraq, &amp; other places.</p>
  
  <p>Why does modern archaeology attribute a Semitic, Arabian and Yemeni origin to these people.
  Naturally, historians are just a bit confused. Soba of Sudan - Descendants of Ham. Saba of Yemen - Descendants of Sam,</p>
  
  <p>Whether or not there is any evidence for their Ethiopian origin as Josephus Flavius suggests.
  This is a tricky question... The Sabeans of Yemen would cross to Ethiopia frequently and indeed there are some of their writings left behind from the 8th century BC around Yeha temple and many historians have hypothesized about the reasons why. The best explanation I’ve found for this is in these two videos below. The whole YouTube channel is quite useful for your inquiry if you’d like to do further research, “Revisionists - official channel” www.revisionists.org .</p>

  <p>Biblical Archeology in Ethiopia - Intro part 2 <a href=""https://youtu.be/srBWW50YlxA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://youtu.be/srBWW50YlxA</a></p>
  
  <p>Now regarding your inquiry for The Queen of Sheba (Soba in Sudan and previously Meroe), ponder on the following verse of The Holy Quran. Her connection to Prophet Solomon (PPBUH) is that a Hoopoe bird was flying when he found the people of Soba in Sudan worshiping the sun and Solomon (PPBUH) invited them to monotheism and merged the two kingdoms by marrying Balqees The Queen of Sheba. The two kingdoms were Ethiopia and Egypt minor that is Sudan today, that could be what Josephus was talking about.</p>
  
  <p>“In Sheba’s homeland there used to be a wonder: two gardens [Metaphor for 2 Rivers], on the right, and on the left. “Eat of your Lord’s provision, and give thanks to Him.” A good land, and a forgiving Lord. But they turned away, so We sent against them a devastating flood; and We substituted their two gardens with two gardens of bitter fruits, thorny shrubs, and meager harvest. We thus penalized them for their ingratitude. Would We penalize any but the ungrateful? Between them and the towns We had blessed, We placed prominent towns, and We made the travel between them easy. “Travel between them by night and day, in safety.” But they said, “Our Lord, lengthen the distances of our journeys.” They wronged themselves; so We made them as tales [of history] and dispersed them in total dispersion. In this are lessons for every steadfast and appreciative person.” - (The Holy Quran, 34:15-19)</p>
  
  <p>The sister that commented above is on point. The ethnic Israelites originally have darker complexion and there are many clues for that in The Bible and Prophet Muhammad (PPBUH) said it bluntly in many of his narrations, he even said Jesus (PPBUH) had a brown complexion (Sahih al-Bukhari, 3438). The modern Jewish identity wasn’t created until after the Babylonian exile when Persian converts entered Judaism. Then the Palestinian Jewish homeland was created by the Hasmonean dynasty who if you look up there names can clearly tell we’re all Seleucid empire converts. This is all supported by historical facts as Palestine was just a bunch of villages before the Hasmoneans and didn’t even have a writing system, they have no archeological proof for the Kingdom of David being there. But anyway, that’s another story for another time. I’m just going to leave you with two more clues so you don’t think I’m crazy or something, one from The Bible and one from The Holy Quran.</p>
  
  <p>Do you agree that the lands of Syria and Palestine have the same produce? Geographically, and for someone who lives in the Middle East, I affirm you that they do. “Judah and Israel traded with you; they exchanged wheat from Minnith and confections, honey, olive oil, and balm for your wares. Damascus did business with you because of your many products and great wealth of goods. They offered wine from Helbon, wool from Zahar.” - (The Bible, Ezekiel 27:17-18). What’s Ethiopia most of famous for? Well, their Injara bread which is unique to their land in Minnith, their honey because it’s all highlands and mountains, their olives and figs, and their Shea butter. When God promised the land of Canaan to Abraham (PPBUH), He promised a land flowing with milk and honey, and He is the best of all to describe anything. If that land had been Palestine, shouldn’t he have said a land flowing with olive oil? God is referring to produce here, and milk is a produce of green lands that cattle eat while honey is a produce of highlands and a mountainous areas. The Holy Quran goes further to prove that Ethiopia is The Holy Land as God mentions “And a tree that springeth forth from Tûr-Sinai [The Mountainous Chain of Sinai] that groweth butter and relish for the eaters.” (23:20). Shea butter is native to Ethiopia and central Africa and it doesn’t grow anywhere else in the planet. As The Bible confirms, Israel and Judea traded balm, that is Shea butter, with Tyre. There are numerous proofs, but truth is precious and only for the diligent seekers.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is the bit that sticks out to me as problematic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, if you discard the spoonfed brainwash that the traditional institutions and academia teach you and embark on some researching using The Holy Quran, The Narrations of Prophet Muhammad (PPBUH), The Bible, some dictionaries, the internet/encyclopedia/history books, and just common sense you would realize that Ethiopia is the land of Canaan that later became the holy land of Israel-Judah.

</blockquote>

<p>There are three things wrong with this:</p>

<ol>
<li>This entire section is, as far as I can tell, completely irrelevant to the question. I don't see how Ethiopia being the holy land of Canaan relates to whether the Sabeans came from there or not. Maybe there is a connection, but Amro needs to make it clearer. I think it got lost somewhere in the giant wall of text that constitutes the final three paragraphs.</li>
<li>Phrases like ""the spoonfed brainwash that the traditional institutions and academia teach you"" are an immediate red flag to me. They make you sound like a conspiracy theorist. (I also find it bizarre how Amro goes straight from trashing the ""traditional institutions and academia"" to suggesting the OP read some history books. Who does he think <em>writes</em> the history books? What does he think academia <em>use</em> to ""brainwash"" people?)</li>
<li>""If you... embark on some researching"" is not something that belongs in a Stack Exchange answer. If you have evidence to back up what you're saying, <em>provide it</em>. The onus is on <em>you</em> to back up what you are saying, not on the OP to go check for themselves.</li>
</ol>

<p>The final three paragraphs, as I mentioned, are quite lengthy and messy, and it's hard to tell how much of it is relevant to the original question. They could definitely do with being broken up or trimmed down.</p>

<p>Overall, however, this <em>is</em> an attempt to answer the question - it directly addresses all  four of OP's queries. It's just hard to tell because it gets sidetracked by issues that don't seem to be directly related.</p>

<p>Having said that, hypotheticals and alternate history are <em>usually</em> out of scope.  History deals with what actually happened. Once we start considering what might have happened, then all opinions are equally valid, and it isn't possible to select an authoritative answer.</p>
<p>The community seems slightly more tolerant of hypothetical questions in the scope of military history. Not my field, but I gather that is an accepted part of the discipline, and there are conventions about how to analyze the forces that constrain the outcomes of military conflicts.</p>
<p>If you are really interested, you may be able to construct the question along the lines of analyzing the forces/constraints/historical trends that governed a situation. We cannot answer what would have happened if Washington had decided not to attend the Continental Congress.  We can however discuss the economic and political strength of pro-union and anti-union forces in the colonies at the time. We can analyze the forces that affected the Articles and be relatively safe in predicting that the Articles would not survive. We can discuss what <em>contemporaries</em> believed about the prognosis, and the plausibility.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the critical factor is &quot;Can we identify an authoritative answer?&quot;  If all answers are equally valid, then the question is out of scope.  Even if most of the answers are clearly wrong, but there are a set of potentially plausible answers, then the question will probably be out of scope.</p>

<p>In the case of history I would say that there are too many crossroads, breaches, sudden changes, opposing and proponent forces for a trend, so that in order for a future projection to have some relevance too many constraints must be identified (and never will there be all of them considered i daresay) and too unrealistic might the assumptions then be, too watered and opinionated the prediction or vision.

<li><strong>However, if I start the close process using this reason, I also provide the link to provide proof of the claim that there is a single link.</strong></li>

<p>As a result, we do have <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3683/site-policy-for-very-heavily-trolled-topics"">a standing site policy</a> that questions on that topic will receive extra scrutiny and much less leeway. I'll repeat it here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Questions on these topics have a hair-trigger for being put on hold.
This goes in particular for new users who don't have a proven
track-record of asking good questions.</strong></p>

<p>In addition, the wiki for <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/holocaust"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;holocaust&#39;"" rel=""tag"">holocaust</a> has this in it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a sensitive and heavily-trolled topic (many questions are from
holocaust deniers trying to get people to agree with them) so
questions on this subject are held to an exceptionally strict
standard.</p>

<p>If the poster had put this tag on their question (which they probably should have), they should have seen that message as well.</p>
<p>So <strong>you can't really use a Holocaust question to talk about how we should be dealing with questions about the history of ice rinks.</strong> They are different kinds of questions, and per-policy, are treated differently.</p>
<p>Going forward, I wouldn't be adverse to putting a phrase like that in some of the other related tags, so it won't be as easily missed. It also wouldn't be a bad idea for us to post a link to that site policy on any question that might run afoul of it. That would serve both as a warning to the question poster, and to any users who might be disappointed if they spend a lot of effort answering a question that's very likely to be closed.</p>

That question presents us with a set of choices for which there are no unequivocally good options.   I was uncomfortable with that question from the moment it was posed; it <em>seemed</em> sincere, but it also seemed like an invitation to the trolls.  Unfortunately I've come to accept that there is a significant overlap between sincere and trollbait. It isn't fair if we act on a sincere question that happens to be trollbait, but it also isn't fair if we fail to act on trollbait that happens to be a sincere question.  T.E.D articulated our current standing policy to resolve this conundrum; I agree with T.E.D and with that policy.  I wish it weren't necessary.</p>

<p>I agree with them in one point: the aggressive downvoting and instinctive closing of concise questions that could be answered with confidence, but apparently are beyond the horizon of some, lowers the quality of this Q&amp;A. Just one example: asking if there are differences between Neanderthals and AMH is a concise question that can easily be answered with peer reviewed articles. Saying it needs clarification looks like ignorance.</p>
<p>Otoh, wildly speculating and claiming out of the blue without source and reason in questions and answers, proliferation of right wing conspiracy bunk, and right away undereducated answers citing second row bible interpretations as a source are being celebrated.</p>
<p>This is about concise Q's and A's that get downvoted (not necessarily the NAZI one, I only share the user's thoughts about &quot;hostility&quot;, not their content) and low quality Q's and A's without source and background that get upvoted, are even celebrated. And about high rated individuals using their rating for arguments of authority.</p>
<p>Example:
Tis <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/60491/has-there-been-any-invasive-plants-warfare-in-the-past"">question</a> refers to media notorious for spreading right wing ideology, fake news and content opposing scientific findings. Of the two answers one names a side line bible interpretation and the other is just an opinion with an unrelated wikipedia link. There is not a single link to actual facts on the matter. A nice example of a post factual &quot;reality&quot;.</p>
<p>Another Question that would belong into the category unsourced and opinionated is the one about &quot;Vercingetorix' constraints&quot; a few weeks ago. High rated people don't source even when asked to do so, but readily close and downvote when lower ranks fail in a minor way. The question could have been a very good start to point out the limits and transitions between history and prehistory had it been asked more on the point and naming the sources that lead to it.</p>
<p>Otoh, an example for a concise <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/60464/are-there-commonalities-between-the-cultural-practices-of-neanderthals-and-moder?r=SearchResults"">question</a> is this. It doesn't need clarification, it actually con not be clearer. Paleo-Anthropology, even genetics meanwhile have a lot to say to it. A remark by a high ranked user shows fundamental lack of expertise.</p>
<p>Poll: Do we want to remind people to stick to published work or at least common text book sense ? Or do we say no, pseudoscience over quality ?</p>

Member for 14 days, 30 answers all over the place and quick succession, and ~300 rep earned for quite questionable content.</p>
<p>The method seems simple enough: post a few excerpts from loosely related Wikipedia pages, most of the time even without any cleanup, and quite a few times apparently without understanding what's quoted, but with ample confirmation bias, then spin some kind of story, no matter its quality and correctness, stringency or even <em>internal consistency.</em></p>
<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/60683"">Here is the latest example</a> of this 'method':</p>
<p>The question isn't stellar, but asks clearly to differentiate between conflicting info:
<a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/47070/did-naddodd-really-discover-iceland"">&quot;Who was first to discover Iceland Pytheas or Naddodd?&quot;</a></p>
<p>What do we see? A string of quotes from Wikipedia, in plain contradiction when read together. Including an unrelated Greenland excourse, and a confusing intro that simply says &quot;seems believable&quot; — without ever in that post clarifying <em>'what'</em> seems believable. By now it seems &quot;Naturally, it got upvoted&quot;.</p>
<p>After comments raised some of the issues present in this post, it <em>was</em> edited, but for the worse. Now it still seems to confirm Naddodd in intro, by using a quote from Wiki that relies on a legend without contextualising or reflecting on the reliability of that source. But it also acknowledges Pytheas earlier presence as possible, just not believed, and also confirms the Irish presence before Naddodd.</p>
<p>Is that a good answer that weighs the evidence it has and states its conclusion clearly and in relation to the question that was asked?</p>
<p>It might contain the elements to become a very good clarifying edit <em>for the question,</em> but it achieves next to nothing in its present form as an answer. Well, except for a certain confusion in readers and a positive rep-change for the poster.</p>
<p>This is not a single incident but present in its peculiar form in <em>every</em> post, though the level of quality is sometimes a little bit better than 'the worst', but never 'good'.</p>
<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/60674"">&quot;Saxons collapsed the Roman Empire in Britain&quot;</a><br />

<a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/60622"">a non-answer where the comment requesting an answer is upvoted 5 times, but the essentially empty post actually still stands as is at +2/-0 vote count</a></p>
<p>Note that the summarising titles chosen above are far from listing all the flaws present in those 'answers'. They just serve to show how wide-ranging comments to point out issues and requests would be, and how often they should have appeared under those posts.</p>
<p>There are two major issues present here:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>How do we treat the user and his posts, that is: convey that this type of regurgitating snippets from Wikipedia to construct a low quality answer is <em>not</em> the way to go? Comments pointing out shortcomings have proven quite unfruitful so far. They even led to hostility as in 'retaliatory voting' and further Wikipedia related nonsense, now in comments</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sub>(&quot;Milesians are psuedo-history en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milesians_(Irish) mythology – <em>–redacted–</em> 3 mins ago&quot;)<br />
[<a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/60630"">Comment under answer</a> to a question that features another example from that very user. Actually a nice example for <em>not</em> using just any first WP-link…?]</sub></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>As a portion of voters here are apparently in the habit of knee-jerk voting, and here upvoting: how can we convey more clearly that no-one should upvote a post 'just because it has a quote'?  (A quote present is desirable, but not a goal in itself, and always merely using unformatted copypasta from Wikipedia is certainly 'a situation improvable')<br />
We need more quality in posts, and upvotes on contradictory answers cobbled together in a hurry that not enough users here seem to check for sources, plausibility and so on?
Another example is actually already mentioned here, but from another user.<br />
(<a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/60637"">This spends a lot of time</a> demonstrating just not having read my prior answer to the problem: claiming without source the very latest English language publication would have been from a guy who died in 2016, while the older answer directly quotes from one article published in 2019!)<br />
This approach to voting up mediocre posts is overall damaging!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Just to counter all these upvotes on subpar answers posted in such quick succession would bring a single user just playing by the rules and vote according to own quality standards <em>when those posts come up</em> into the territory of automated voting-fraud-script detection.<br />
Also note that in a declined flag comment it was directly demanded to be raised on meta.</p>

Recent changes in SE corporate policy have (in my opinion) made it very difficult for moderators to respond to questions like this.  &quot;Friendly&quot; is now paramount over all other considerations. (I'm not whining about the change, but the constraint does affect my answer).</p>
<p>Quality always emerges as a function of a number of different quality standards. Only in the simplest possible situations can quality be measured directly.  A golf score of 72 is better than a golf score of 80 because we structure the game and the rules and the scoring to ensure that measurement &amp; comparison is simple.  Measuring quality outside a game space is much more challenging.</p>
<p>There is a huge difference between the quality of a zero link answer and a one link answer.   Almost all of the time I will prefer an answer with a link over one that contains mere opinions.  The marginal contribution to quality after the first link diminishes, although I won't comment on how quickly.</p>
<p>A second quality principle is how responsive the answer is to the question.   We (I include myself very explicitly in this category) have a tendency to infodump  - to provide loads of information, about topics that interest us.  Sometimes in the process of researching and editing, and improving, the answer gets larger than the question or occasionally diverges from the question. (sometimes the question moves, but that is a different issue).</p>
<p>In theory, overly large answers aren't a problem; in practice every word beyond the minimum necessary increases the problem that the answer will be challenged and the interaction will be dragged down into a morass of negotiations about details that risks slipping over the edge into acrimony.</p>
<p>There are probably other quality standards, but in a perfect world the answer would respond to the question, the whole question and nothing but the question. There would be no doubt in anyone's mind that this answer is perfectly matched to this question.</p>

<p>What is the mission of this site? Now I could be wrong, having come here from StackOverflow, which handles such things very differently, but shouldn't it be a starting point for research? I mean, if you want to answer a question about History, wouldn't you want people to come here first - and hopefully stay?</p>
<p>With that in mind, consider the Too basic response: &quot;This question is too basic; it can be definitively answered by a single link to the relevant topic on Wikipedia or another standard reference source&quot;</p>
<p>This response is wrong on so many levels.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It is often false. I posted a question and received this response and I saw another question with this response and in both cases there is no single site as asserted with the answer, not on Wikipedia and not on another standard reference source. That's a 100% failure rate so far. I will bet my salary there are a multitude of others. Why make such an assertion unless it is true in all cases?</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is vague. Too basic for a 4th grader is not that same as too basic for a history professor at Stanford. You don't filter your users based on historical expertise so why would you make such a broad assertion?</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is condescending. Imagine you are on the receiving end of such a comment. You have spent maybe an hour or more researching a question, then trying to frame it so the question gods don't strike you down for daring to ask in a way that is improper. That's not an insignificant investment in time, even for a 4th grader. You then get a canned response saying you didn't do enough. How can you NOT interpret that as a slight.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From a recipient's perspective &quot;Too basic&quot; is another way of saying:</p>
<p>a) You are not worthy of our time</p>
<p>b) You shouldn't be so lazy - go away</p>
<p>c) This question is too stupid for an answer (Substitute stupid for basic and you are literally saying this!!)</p>
<p>d) <strong>You</strong> are too stupid for an answer.</p>
<p>Now imagine English is not your first language and you spent a ton of time trying to put together a question in a language you don't really understand only to end up with a response like this. You have just magnified the insult.</p>
<ol start=""4"">
<li>It doesn't offer <strong>any</strong> assistance whatsoever. It doesn't tell you where to go (other than a generic Wikipedia reference) or provide any recommendation on how to obtain an answer. At the <strong>very least</strong> it should provide a link to a page that shows HOW to find the answer you are looking for. It completely overlooks the fact that somebody invested real time to come HERE for an answer only to get figuratively crapped on and turned away with nothing to show for it.</li>
</ol>
<p>For those of us in the &quot;<strong>The only stupid question is the one not asked</strong>&quot; category, labeling a question as &quot;too basic&quot; is an intellectual affront. If one person asks it, the odds are extremely good that others have the exact same question but won't make the effort to ask - so we as a group lose. This site also becomes less relevant as a consequence. That's just a fact.</p>
<p>I get that some questions are pretty silly or off-topic or trolling or whatever. I have no issue with those; they should be pretty obvious and handled appropriately. It is readily apparent, however, that there are real questions requiring real answers getting flushed into the ether by the &quot;too basic&quot; response.</p>
<p>On StackOverflow, programming questions quite often get repeated and others are extremely basic - at the level of &quot;what is the power button for?&quot;. They have come to recognize that sometimes it can be hard to even realize an answer exists when it appears obvious to someone else. I have seen literally thousands of questions and never once seen one closed for being &quot;too basic&quot;. They get closed when a question has already been asked and answered and a link is provided with the original answer. In that way, nobody gets insulted or turned away with nothing. They may not like the original answer but at least they get one.</p>
<p>Most importantly, they almost never get redirected elsewhere. It happens occasionally but at such a rate it makes no sense to go anywhere else first when looking for an answer. I tell my CS students that when they get stuck, they should start with StackOverflow as the most likely place to find an answer.</p>
<p>I fail to understand why Stack History hasn't taken the exact same approach. If I was a history professor with students looking to maximize their time, shouldn't I want to direct them to a place where historians and enthusiasts collectively gather and share their insights?</p>
<p>I have run across a distinctly and disturbingly elitist attitude on this site which is personified in the &quot;Too basic&quot; response to certain questions and I think it bleeds into some of the &quot;answers&quot; I have seen as well. I was given an &quot;answer&quot;, which was useless as it didn't really address the original question properly, but not before being upbraided for not doing enough or proper research beforehand - all without knowing an iota about the what effort I had put beforehand.</p>
<p>Perhaps you disagree, but I personally envision this site to be, at the very least, the starting place for anyone wanting answers to history's questions, period. That won't happen, however, if one of your core responses is to literally insult your reader and tell them to go elsewhere.</p>
<p>Am I just wrong here? Is Stack History trying to be the goto site for all things history or just a sight where the snobs gather to demonstrate how smart they are or some version in between?</p>

<hr>
<p>Firstly, in answer to your question</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who decides whether a question is &quot;Too basic&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is <strong>any member of the site with sufficient rep to have been awarded the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/close-questions"">cast close and reopen votes privilege</a></strong>.  That is the same as any other site on the SE network.  Of course, many members who have that privilege choose not to exercise it, but that is a different issue.</p>
<hr>
<p>As a community, we are not always very good at communicating the site rules and expectations to new members (I hope to elaborate my thoughts on that in another post later today or tomorrow).</p>
<p>However, the scope of the site was agreed by the community long before I joined, and is set out in the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/tour"">site tour</a> and in our <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">Help Centre</a>.  For what it's worth, I think that the current scope is actually quite reasonable, given the limitations of the SE question and answer format, but I know that others feel differently.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>As regards this specific case</strong>, I was one of those who voted to close (as the 5th vote, to avoid using my Moderator 'super-vote' - see below).  I will try to explain why I did so:</p>
<p>From our <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">Help Centre</a>: &quot;<em>Questions answered by a simple Google search or to be found in a Wikipedia page</em>&quot; are off-topic.  In this case, from the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/posts/60845/revisions"">edit history</a>, the original version of your question was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looking at the Midway timeline I see the Hiryu launched two separate attacks on the Yorktown, one consisting of dive bombers and the other of torpedo bombers. Given the attacks were less than 3 hours apart they couldn't have been the same planes so why not send the groups together in a massed attack rather than two smaller separate attacks? Seems like Japanese doctrine favored massed attacks so why did they instead go for the option more likely to fail? TIA</p>

<p>Now, when I enter <code>Hiryu Midway</code> into Google, the very first page returned is the Wikipedia article on the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Hiry%C5%AB"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū</a>.  Section 2.3 of that article covers Hiryū's service at the Battle of Midway.</p>
<p><strong>As far as I can see, that section of the article completely answers that version of your question</strong>.  I know that the results returned by Google depend on a lot of external factors (not least the location of the user), but - in the absence of any statement to the contrary by you - I have to assume that you would also get that result from that search.</p>
<p>So, in this case, the question <strong>as asked</strong> is both answered by a simple Google search <em>and</em> found in a Wikipedia page.  That is why I added the fifth vote to close the question as <em>Too Basic</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Moderator &quot;Super-Votes&quot;</strong></p>
<p>As an aside, it is, perhaps, worth noting here that the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/124106/437864"">general advice to moderators on SE</a> is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you see a post you think should be closed, close it. When you see a post you think should be re-opened, re-open it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, here on History:SE, moderators generally try to exercise a lighter touch, preferring to let the community decide which questions should be closed, and which should be re-opened.</p>
<p>Obviously, there will be some exceptions to that general case.  As you note, we do get questions from trolls and other bad-actors.  Obvious troll-posts tend to be deleted on sight, but we also get more subtle cases where the situation might be more complicated.</p>
<p>An example of the latter might be sock-puppet accounts where an individual creates multiple accounts on SE.  Those accounts are then used to upvote their own posts, post supportive comments on questions or answers, attempt to deflect legitimate criticism, suggest edits to &quot;improve&quot; problematic posts, etc.</p>
<p>Without going into detail, you might reasonably assume that moderators have access to tools that enable them to identify and deal with some of these cases and, when necessary, we can escalate to SE staff.  Those SE staff have access to more detail than is available to site moderators, and can apply sanctions across the entire network where necessary.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Edits that invalidate existing answers</strong></p>
<p>I note that your question has been extensively edited since that original version.  However, that original version was also answered by another user before the question was closed.  The community has previously expressed an opinion that <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3598/24858"">questions should not generally be edited in a way that invalidates existing answers</a>.</p>
<p>You may not like or agree with that answer, but someone took the time and effort to post it, and that should be respected.  If you disagree with it, or feel that the answer is not useful, by all means down-vote, but don't simply change the question in a way that invalidates it.</p>
<p>Personally, I happen to agree with the community position here.  But even if I didn't I would be reluctant to vote to re-open a question that was edited in this way, given that I am a site moderator - a representative of the community - and that the community has expressed that view.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, coming to your last question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is Stack History trying to be the goto site for all things history or just a sight [sic] where the snobs gather to demonstrate how smart they are or some version in between?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd say the answer is clearly something in between your two extremes.</p>
<hr>
<p>As I said above, the scope of the site is set out in our Site Tour and Help Centre.  In addition to that, the expectation that people will have done at least some research before they post their question is built into every SE site. The section <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask"">How do I ask a good question?</a> is explicit when it asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Have you thoroughly searched for an answer before asking your question?</strong> Sharing your research helps everyone. Tell us what you found and why it didn’t meet your needs. This demonstrates that you’ve taken the time to try to help yourself, it saves us from reiterating obvious answers, and above all, it helps you get a more specific and relevant answer!</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>(my emphasis)</li>
</ul>
<p>(I understand the content on that page is common to all sites across the SE network.)</p>
<p>What's more, a lack of evidence of prior research is an <em>explicit</em> reason for down-voting a question.  As the tooltip states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This question does not show any research effort; it is unclear or not useful</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Now, we do have a higher bar for questions on sensitive subjects like the Holocaust or Nazis (for obvious reasons, given the problems we've had with Nazi trolls in the past).
But beyond that, I think that pretty-much any question that meets the basic criteria set out in our Help Centre, and which demonstrates some evidence of prior research, is likely to be perfectly acceptable to our community, and will probably be well-received here on History:SE.</p>

<p>This site is moderated by the users, and they make moderation decisions like holds, reopens, deletions, and votes, at their discretion. Like a Supreme Court, their verdict is the law, agree with it or not. (And of course nobody who loses a decision ever agrees with it).</p>
<p>Site policy for good questions and answers is, by definition, what their votes say it is.</p>
<p>As for the &quot;too basic&quot;, the original rationale for it is <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/494/when-is-a-question-too-basic-or-general-reference-for-the-site"">here</a> and <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3700/is-it-time-to-update-our-custom-close-reasons/3701#3701"">here</a> (among probably other places I'm missing). The general gist of it is that we want answers on this site to be a little more than just the ability to paraphrase (or even just quote) the relevant section in Wikipedia. We aren't here to be a free Wikipedia reading service. We're here for the hard stuff, not the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alley-oop_(basketball)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">alley-oop slam dunks</a>.</p>
<p>I do think there is a bit of a problem with the wording of &quot;too basic&quot;. It seemed OK at the time, but it turns out &quot;basic&quot; <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/basic-dictionary-word_n_7215002"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">is an insult</a> to at least one of the younger generations coming up, and I don't think we realized at the time how pejorative that would appear to some people. Rest assured, we mean nothing insulting by it. Its just not a type of question that fits our format well.</p>
<p>That being said, our close reasons are often more <em>descriptive</em> than <em>prescriptive</em>. Sometimes people just want to close a question for complex reasons that don't exactly fit into a close reason with machine precision. In those cases, it seems like they will pick the closest close reason. Turning around and arguing that the question doesn't precisely fit that close reason <em>completely misses the point</em>. There are things about the question that the site's users thought made it not appropriate here. Listen to their concerns and address them, or expect the question to stay closed.</p>

I started out with a few curious questions here, and these got treated a lot better than my a-lot-more-inexperienced questions on StackOverflow. In that way, I don't think this is necessarily a question of the site but rather the vocal minority of users and what they may or may not like/dislike.</p>
<p>I originally voted to close your question because the first answer expressed an opinion that it was very easily answerable. I have, in the past, demonstrated that I disagree with the 'Too basic' closure reason because searches give different results based on one's location. In this case, I was swept by the first answers' authoritative nature, but I was probably mistaken, especially taking into account the complexity of the edit and what it displays about the situation which ruled during that battle.</p>
<p>Overall, I have tried to argue against the 'too basic' reasons because it sounds, much as you described, too weird for me to really accept. There's a difference between &quot;how long did Egypt last?&quot; and &quot;why were the pyramids built?&quot; though both would be closed by the same reason on this site.</p>
<p>I should add two things: I think the difficulty of wording a question such that it doesn't get closed gets more difficult the longer one spends on H:SE, but also the quality of answers one can find here is very high if the previous barrier is crossed. Given the frequency with which some aspect of this site's closure/acceptance of topics gets raised on Meta, I think it's clear there's a different understanding at H:SE compared to other SE sites.</p>

<p>It is not that there is anything that I find particularly onerous or burdensome about the new agreement.  It's simply that some parts require a level of trust between moderators and SE Inc (particularly paras 4 and 5 of the new agreement).  Following last year's events, I feel that SE has forfeited that trust.</p>
<p>You probably all know that, now that History:SE has graduated from beta, there will be elections for a new moderator team at some point (although I understand there is currently something of a backlog due to a shortage of Community Managers).  As a result of what happened last year, I had already pretty-much decided that I wasn't going to stand in those elections.  The introduction of the new moderator agreement just means that I am standing down rather sooner that I had intended to.  This post is intended to explain why I made that decision.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we will still have three great moderators in place, which makes me feel a lot better about stepping down now.</p>

<hr>
<h1>I know what SE did last summer</h1>
<p>For clarity, this is my take on what happened last year:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Leaving aside the question of whether removing Monica Cellio as a moderator was justified, SE were completely within their rights to de-mod her.  Despite the fact that Monica was hugely liked and respected by the SE community, the (current) Moderator agreement explicitly says &quot;<em>Stack Exchange Inc. reserves the right to terminate my privileges as a moderator at any time without warning</em>&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>However, the timing of that removal and the way that it was actually done shows what we used to euphemistically call a 'training deficit', or to put it more bluntly, a level of ineptitude and disregard for Monica's feelings that almost beggars belief.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, while all of that made me angry, there was nothing so far that actually made me reconsider my decision to put myself forward to become a pro-tem moderator on History:SE.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Then came the infamous interview in The Register.  For me, that crossed a line.  That they would deliberately defame someone who had worked hard as an unpaid volunteer to make SE sites better, and ensure that the network actually works, made me really angry. In fact, it still does, if I'm being honest.  Notwithstanding the fact that they've now come to a legal agreement (and I hope that cost them a fortune!), I've been really thinking hard about whether I wanted to remain as an SE moderator since then.  That interview showed what SE:Inc really thinks about the moderators on its sites.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now, I know that in a legal sense (as the current Moderator Agreement makes abundantly clear), &quot;<em>I am an independent volunteer moderator to Stack Overflow and I am not an employee, agent or representative of Stack Exchange Inc</em>&quot;.  However, as moderators we do represent our communities.  And what is Stack Exchange if not the collection of its communities?  So, in a very real sense, as moderators, we <em>do</em> represent SE.  And I'm simply just not comfortable about that any more.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The subsequent sacking of respected Community Managers with little or no notice, and the way that they have handled the re-licensing of user content, really didn't help matters.  (And while I have great sympathy for the remaining, badly over-worked, CMs, the fact that they are over-worked is the direct result of a deliberate decision made by the company management)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1>Re-licensing</h1>
<p>As for that re-licensing, the SE ToS forms a legal contract (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/legal/terms-of-service#contracts"">Section 2</a> of the ToS makes that point explicit).  I'm no lawyer, but I'm pretty sure that unilaterally varying the terms of a contract without formal notice to all parties is illegal - even in New York.  It would certainly be illegal under UK and/or EU law.  I'm also pretty sure that the legal advice to SE will have been something along the lines of: &quot;<em>challenging the change in court would be ruinously expensive, so nobody is going to do it</em>&quot;.  And they are probably right, particularly if the case has to be brought in the US.  (And on top of that, it's no secret that international copyright law is a hot mess anyway!)</p>
<p>My background has included creating elearning materials, as well as producing reports and other content while working as an historical researcher.  Copyright and licensing were explicitly covered in pretty-much every contract I've signed over the years.  As far as I'm concerned, those licensing rules actually do matter.  Now, if I had been asked, I would probably simply have agreed to the change without a second thought.  <em><strong>But we weren't asked!</strong></em>  Personally, I find that unacceptable, and if I'm being honest, it makes me less-inclined even to contribute to SE sites, never mind moderate one.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Closer to home</h1>
<p>In addition, while thinking about the broader SE ecosystem, I realised something important about History:SE itself.  We routinely talk about &quot;<em>the History:SE community</em>&quot;, but it is clear to me that there are actually multiple communities, who each believe that our site should be something rather different.  For myself, I'd like to think that we should be aiming for higher-quality questions and answers. I think we should ideally be a site where non-trivial assertions in questions and answers should always be supported by citations, or those questions and answers should be discarded.</p>
<p>(That being said, however, the fact that &quot;Quality&quot; was conspicuously absent from the KPIs that SE:Inc listed last year didn't go unnoticed!)</p>
<p>It's clear that there are others who think differently from me here on History:SE.  There are some who think that even the existing rules are too strict (as evidenced by voting patterns in review queues, amongst other things).  One relatively high-rep user actually said in a recent comment on our meta that they thought we should allow &quot;<em>anything except obvious homework questions</em>&quot;.  While I don't agree with them, I accept that those views are also valid.</p>
<p>My problem is that I'm really not sure that my views represent the majority view any more.  And, given all that, I don't think I know how to &quot;represent the community&quot; as a moderator.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Regrets, I have a few ...</h1>
<p>My main regret is that I haven't been able to do as much as I had hoped to make the site more supportive towards new users.  Unfortunately, every time the subject is raised it seems to devolve into a discussion about whether the wording in our canned responses is 'fluffy' enough.  The wording of our standard comments could certainly bear improvement, but I suspect the roots of the problem lie deeper.</p>
<p>I think the real problem is that we just aren't very good at communicating our rules and our expectations to new users.  I know that there are many others here who think that new users should just take a little time to look around and see how we do things here.  My response is that would be fine, if we were consistent, but we really aren't.</p>
<hr>
<p>To illustrate my point with a specific example:</p>
<p>Our <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">Help Centre</a> in unambiguous when it states that &quot;<em>Questions answered by a simple Google search or to be found in a Wikipedia page</em>&quot; are explicitly off-topic.  Such questions are regularly, and rightly, closed by the community.  In most cases, people don't post answers to those questions, beyond pointing out the relevant Wikipedia page in comments.  In most cases, but certainly not in all.</p>
<p>For example, the question <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/55377/24858"">Were there any monarchs of England or the United Kingdom who were not technically first in the line of succession?</a> is answered by not just one, but two Wikipedia pages.  Those pages were pointed out in comments (I posted one of those comments, which is why I am particularly familiar with this example), and the OP of the question replied &quot;<em>Those Wikipedia pages do have the information I need. I had looked at a few Wikipedia Articles about the monarchy, but I didn't come across those ones. Thank you</em>&quot;.  Unfortunately, they didn't then delete the question.</p>
<p>Half-an-hour later, the first relatively high-rep user posted an answer.  That was followed by four more.  The question even made it onto the HNQ list!</p>
<p>Now, I'm not trying to single out that question or blame those high-rep users.  There are plenty of other examples I could have chosen (some of which have not been closed because some users prefer not to close questions with answers).  In any case, that is exactly how the gamification of SE was designed to work.  Questions like this, even when off-topic, are the &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot; that help people accumulate reputation and badges more quickly.  <strong>But the sad reality is that it doesn't help new users understand our rules and expectations</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I've fielded far too many questions along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;why was &lt;<em>my off-topic question</em>&gt; closed when &lt;<em>another equally off-topic question</em>&gt; was left open and/or answered&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IMO, it's that kind of experience that makes us seem 'unwelcoming' to new users, rather than the wording of our standard responses.  At least those standard comments mean the user now gets some feedback on why their question was closed, which has been a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>My opinion, for whatever it's worth, is that we probably need a comprehensive set of FAQ (perhaps similar to those on Skeptics:SE) which clearly set out our expectations and guidelines.  We can then link to those FAQ from our Help Centre and in any standard comments.  Unfortunately, in order to establish that, and agree the content of those FAQ, we would probably need some agreed method of establishing consensus, and <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3989/24858"">that seems to be problematic</a>.</p>
<p>I have been unable to square that circle.  Maybe others will have more success in the future.</p>
<hr>
<h1>And finally ...</h1>
<p>Being a moderator on History:SE can sometimes present rather ... <em>unique</em> ... challenges.  I think it's fair to say that our intervention is not always universally welcomed!</p>
<p>I have been fortunate to have been supported by the other moderators here on History:SE, and by the wider SE moderator community, which certainly made the job much easier.  It has been a huge privilege for me to help bring this site to graduation, and I hope that my contributions have been (at least mostly) positive, and have helped make the site a better place for everyone.</p>
<p>Well, better for everyone except the Nazi trolls, obviously.</p>

<p>I'd suggest to our users that <strong>we ought to get over that</strong>. Skeptics only had about 9 questions successfully posted in the last 3 days. In that same time, we had 13. In fact, we've been getting more questions per day than them for years, even before we left Beta. In many of the ways that count, we are a bigger site than Skeptics.</p>

,4168,,,,2020-10-01T17:12:54.950,26786,2,,2020-10-01T12:57:12.327,,,,26786,,"<p>The title seems to ask &quot;why was another user's question left open&quot; while it looks in the body more like &quot;why were my similar questions closed&quot;?</p>
<p>Why a specific question is left open is often hard to understand, fathom or explain. It is often easier to try and retrace the reasons why a specific question was closed. That there might exist some discrepancy in 'equal treatment' of similar questions could be one problem we need to try to address, as is the tendency of growing reluctance to either close or further improve – that is sometimes: change – a question once it has received an answer or even several of those. If that is the primary purpose of this meta question, then I would simply agree with you: that the 'left open' example should have been closed as well, and certainly that it should not have been allowed onto the hot network question list nor stay there for as long as it did.</p>
<p>However, since I participated in no actions either way on the listed questions, I can only offer what I think is the more important aspect for this meta-post: <em>'why were my questions closed?'</em></p>
<p>In this case it seems to be further a question of <em>'why are my movie inspired questions closed?'</em></p>
<p>That movies seldom are and really often cannot be historically fully accurate should come at no surprise. That some look more like it and some even claim to be closer to 'the truth' is another matter. Very often they invent scenes, dialogue, dramatise events and mess with chronology. Artistic license and entertainment value always trump historical accuracy. But that just means that the informational value of 'movies' is generally very low.</p>
<p>The examples of questions you posted yourself which were closed were all 'inspired by movies'. That in itself is fine – with me. (And in several aspects also OK with other Meta users: <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3763/can-movies-be-considered-usable-for-reference"">Can movies be considered usable for reference?</a>)<br />
Inspiration can come from anywhere, even random everyday musings or observations. Your questions were even positively identifying the movie with name and stills and links to an accessible platform. That is a plus.</p>
<p>But the problems I would have had with those questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personally, I would have been disinterested in both the inspiration and the topic. Perhaps other users would be interested, I'd simply not vote in any way for that.</li>
<li>In each case it isn't really clear to me whether the questions were about 'the history' or 'the movie'. Or: is HistorySE really the ideal place for that question? A point that would need 'fixing' and it would probably be accomplished by addressing the following point:</li>
<li>I would have been dismayed for that they all lacked any indication of you trying to solve the problem yourself. In other words: no prior research evident. This would have been prompting me to vote down and to vote to close as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is illustrated by a comment that said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As far as I can see, your question about HumVees was answered by the Wikipedia page on the HumVee (per my comment on the question). Irrespective of the inspiration behind it, that particular question was therefore off-topic for being 'too basic' (as explained in our <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">Help Centre</a>). – sempaiscuba♦</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That looks to me like there are now some options for further action:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clarify this meta question as to whether it is more about sub-standard question being left open or your own questions being closed.</li>
<li>If you just do not like the 'open question' to remain open: vote to close that question.</li>
<li>If you want your own questions to be undeleted, try to edit them into a format that makes them on-topic. One aspect I'd require would be that they should show more prior research. Then flag them for undeletion review.</li>
<li>If you want to ask more 'movie inspired' questions, then go ahead, and make sure you <em>do not post your question immediately after watching</em> the movie, but after you tried to solve your puzzle yourself. Document your research in the question post. Depending on far you get, you then might even post your own answer to your question.</li>
</ol>
<p>If points 3 and 4 are the main focus here, for moving forward perhaps also revisit more posts on 'question quality' here on meta.</p>

<li><p>We, the Community Team, will be providing a small selection of generic questions. The first two will be guaranteed to be included, the latter ones are if the community doesn't supply enough questions. This will be done in a single post, unlike the prior instruction.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If your question contains a link, please use the syntax of <code>[text](link)</code>, as that will make it easier for transcribing for the finished questionnaire.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This is a perfect opportunity to voice questions that are specific to your community and issues that you are running into currently.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At the start of the nomination phase, the Community Team will select <strong>up to 8 of the top voted questions submitted by the community</strong> provided in this thread, to use in addition to the aforementioned 2 guaranteed questions. We reserve some editorial control in the selection of the questions and may opt not to select a question that is tangential or irrelevant to moderation or the election.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once questions have been selected, a new question will be opened to host the actual questionnaire for the candidates, typically containing 10 questions in total.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This is not the only option that users have for gathering information on candidates. As a community, you are still free to, for example, hold a live chat session with your candidates to ask further questions, or perhaps clarifications from what is provided in the Q&amp;A.</p>

In particular, I'm interested in any opinions the community might have on a few proposed edits.</p>
<p>Here is the question statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What proportion of US government revenue was from federal vs state vs
local governments between 1790 and 1846?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In its current form, the question is too unfocused. In <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4173/good-practices-before-flagging-a-deleted-question-for-moderator-attention#comment9773_4173"">this comment</a> the great <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/users/4935/semaphore"">Semaphore</a> advised to add more detail in the question statement, and to organize my section on background research better in order to make clear how it is relevant to the question.</p>
<p>To that end, I have a few ideas. I would appreciate any criticism of these ideas and/or new ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define my terms better, e.g. revenue and federal/state/local government, or explain the types of revenue estimates I would be looking for.</li>
<li>Demonstrate that the question is well-founded, e.g. demonstrate that local governments were constituted in a recognizable way at the time or that accounting records were sometimes kept during the period.</li>
<li>Specify better the form of answer that I'm looking for, e.g. do I want three numbers for the whole period, or time series, or do I just want sources, or qualitative evidence, etc.</li>
<li>Discuss challenges and approaches to answering the question.</li>
<li>Add some discussion to the beginning of my background research section describing what each research finding is intended to demonstrate and/or what the whole thing is intended to demonstrate, and what I perceive to be the limitations of my background research.</li>
<li>Add a discussion of background research that I have not found to be useful, but which demonstrates prior effort.</li>
</ol>
<p>One problem with a lot of these ideas is that they involve &quot;adding more words,&quot; and I want to avoid cluttering my question.</p>
<p>I have tried to do this on my own, but I still don't think it's good enough, so I don't want to bother the moderators yet with a flag. At the same time I feel like I have reached the point of diminishing returns as far as what I can do on my own. There is also the possibility that this question is somehow too dumb to fix, and that people are too nice to tell me. I'd be interested to hear that too!</p>

<p>So, to continue with your example of medieval widgetbricks, a brief, and non-exhaustive, checklist might be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is there a Wikipedia page about widgetbricks?  If so, what does it say about medieval widgetbricks?  Why doesn't that answer your question?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Check to see if someone has already posted a question on History:SE about the particular details of medieval widgetbricks you are interested in.  If there are other questions about medieval widgetbricks (beside the ones you've already cited as inspiration), make a point of explaining why they don't answer your question.  This can help avoid having your question wrongly closed as a duplicate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Carry out a Google search for <code>medieval widgetbrick</code>, and any other keywords you think might help (<em>other search engines are available</em>).  As a general guide, start broad with as few terms as possible, and add additional terms to narrow the results as you go.  Include the details of your search(es), the search engine, and the results returned, in your question.  Even negative results help others not to have to duplicate that research. What more are you hoping for? (Be as specific as possible.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(<strong>Remember that other people may receive different results for the same search, depending on their location and past search history (among other factors), so don't just assume they can reproduce your search results</strong>).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You should probably also search for keywords on <a href=""https://scholar.google.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google Scholar</a>.  Include the details of your search (for example <code>medieval widgetbrick</code>), and the results returned, in the body of your question (even if it's just saying something like &quot;<em>nothing on the first few pages of results looks like it might contain the answer</em>&quot;).  What more are you looking for? (Again, it helps to be as specific as possible).</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you do find interesting books / papers that look like they may answer your question, but they are behind a paywall, then list them in the body of your question.  Someone here might have access.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Put those same keywords into the search box on <a href=""https://archive.org/index.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Internet Archive</a>.  Do any of the books or papers returned help?  Even if they didn't, you should at least say <em>why</em> you think they don't help in the body of your question, so that others don't have to repeat your research.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Even if your research <em>does</em> eventually answer your question, you might still consider posting a <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/self-answer"">self-answered question</a> if you feel that the answers you found might be of interest to others.  This can be a great way to document your research.</li>

<p>As you may be aware, Stack Exchange moderators have some special abilities that go with the role. One of these is the so-called 'super-vote', such that:
Moderator votes are binding. Any place we have voting — close, open, delete, undelete, offensive, migration, etc — that vote will reach the threshold and take effect immediately if a single moderator casts a vote.</p>
<p>The general advice to moderators is:</p>
<p>When you see a post you think should be closed, close it. When you see a post you think should be re-opened, re-open it. If you're not sure, don't do either. We've entrusted you with the ability to perform both of those tasks instantly - so use them judiciously.</p>
<p>Clearly, obvious troll posts and spam should be closed (and deleted) immediately. However, the question of whether posts should be closed is not always that clear. In recent years, moderators on History:SE have generally used a lighter touch, and preferred (where possible) to allow the community to decide.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>So where do you think the line should be drawn?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I would prefer to be very slow. While moderators have a great deal of power, the community should have more power to determine the culture and future of the site.  There is a reason why we reward people for reviewing posts; overly quick action by the moderator denies the community the chance to act.  (if the post is hateful or hurtful, then quick action is needed)</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This is tough; the answer lies in the particulars.  To the extent that I can articulate a general response:  First, listen to the user to see if there is a pattern or root cause that can be addressed.  Second, process the flags fairly; try to ignore the user's rep and engage with the content of the flag.  Third, if the pattern rises to an actionable level discuss with other mods to make sure that I'm not over-reacting and that I'm not missing something.  Fourth, <em>if</em> I can identify the pattern in a clear and actionable way, communicate with the user (chat or mod message) identifying the pattern and the desired change.  But underlying all those is to try to understand the effect this has on the community.  There may be other options to manage this situation, but they're going to depend on details that aren't present in the hypothetical.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>It happens.  We are different people with different outlooks.  We're strive to cooperate to build something that isn't yet defined, which means that I am not in possession of the blueprint.  If someone else's moderation is contrary to mine, that may help me to better understand the shared vision.  I'm pleasantly surprised by how frequently we agree. The election means that there will likely be at least one more mod, so the consensus will need to be reforged.  <sup>1</sup> This is the kind of situation where disagreement is very likely to be constructive - to reveal something new about what we collectively want.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start=""4"">
<li>In your opinion, what do moderators do?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Exception processing, and executive action.  If something happens that could damage the community before the community has a chance to come to a consensus, moderators should act to give the community time.  Under normal conditions, the community is self-managing itself, and the result is a kind of pleiostasis (homeostasis with multiple semi-stable chaotic attractors); if something unexpected happens, the moderator may need to step in to give the community time to stabilize.  Finally, moderators act as the executive will of the community - unfortunately this is most frequent in troll bashing - there are people/forces that are inimical to the community; they are best suppressed by prompt action and minimal attention. Trolls thrive on attention and discussion; prompt moderator action can starve the troll.</p>

<ol start=""5"">
<li>A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Uncomfortable. There are days when I want to fire off a snap rejoinder, but I don't think I can.  There are things I do that I  hope contribute to improving the site; things that I would do with or without the diamond. I try to be more cautious and respectful about those activities because of the diamond.  If I am ever comfortable with the diamond, I think it will be time for me to yield the diamond.</p>

<p>&quot;more effective&quot; is a judgemental word<sup>2</sup>, like &quot;beauty&quot; or &quot;secure&quot;; it doesn't have any meaning without a metric. I'm not sure what the OP of this question intended that word to mean. I'll continue to participate and answer where I can, and I'm sure I'll garner reputation on that basis, but I'm well past the diminishing marginal return on that reward.  Where I want to be effective is to improve the community - to make it more friendly and more helpful.  To clarify questions where clarity is needed, to do what I can to avoid closing questions over small punctillio's when the core of the question is fundamentally interesting. To help users with &lt; 100 rep get past that reputation boundary. To build a better meta site with references that more clearly explain our culture, and to adapt that culture to changes in the community.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm a regular participant in Charcoal with close-vote privileges on several sites, so I see closing as just another part of the same general goal of moderation. Close-worthy questions are often targets of spam and Not An Answer (NAA) posts, so closing them when I encounter them as part of another moderation activity is a service to the community just like handling problematic answers themselves. Leaving questions open, of course, can deliver the message to users that such questions are considered acceptable - a bad example!</p>
<p>In general, I agree with the above statement that the community should be the <em>primary</em> close team whenever it is reasonably possible. I side with the old saw about diamond moderators being &quot;human exception handlers&quot; - they should get involved if the community is having trouble keeping up with all the flags or has indicated a desire for help, but back off when the community is actively keeping the site clean themselves.</p>
<p>There has been a long-standing problem on Stack Overflow with moderators declining to step up and close questions even as the community was overwhelmed with thousands of questions in the close votes queue, unable to make headway due to limited reviews and votes per day. I'm not a believer in that. If the community needs help, then I need to do it! That's what being an exception handler often is!</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>There are several different flags, so appropriate action really depends on the situation. Some users generate a large number of helpful comments that eventually become obsolete, so getting a lot of &quot;It's no longer needed&quot; flags for such users is normal and expected - I would just process the flags and move on.</p>
<p>In a scenario where a user is actively causing <em>strife</em>, my general rule is that we need a base level of civility in order to have a working site. Question quality and answer quality have little meaning if people are being driven from the site!</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I would review the question's history and any notes that have been made in order to apprise myself of the full situation surrounding the action. At that point, if I felt the action was <em>clearly</em> a mistake, I would probably reverse it. If there was a significant doubt, I would bring it before the other mods and/or the community itself for a discussion, doing my best to develop a consensus.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start=""4"">
<li>In your opinion, what do moderators do?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Moderators are the faithful leaders that keep the community working smoothly. They are the glue to the community's rubber. They occasionally must make a hard decision (e.g. suspending a long-time user), but should strive to avoid such scenarios wherever possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start=""5"">
<li>A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I strive to maintain a consistently high level of quality and civility, so I don't object to having my past actions reviewed with a different standard as long as civility is kept! I also admit that I am not perfect and am open to constructive criticism, and will strive to always be respectful.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>So where do you think the line should be drawn? How proactive do you think moderators should be in closing posts which may be off-topic, based on the criteria in our help centre?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe moderators should proactively close grossly offensive or unambiguously off-topic posts. For example, holocaust/genocide denial, spam, or clearly non-historical questions. Such posts will assuredly be closed by the community at large, so mods should save everyone time and effort by dealing with them ASAP.</p>
<p>With legitimate posts, I believe in a more nuanced approach. In general, moderators should be restrained in the exercise of their powers, and respect the will of the community at large, including Meta consensuses. I will generally intervene in extraordinary cases, where drawing upon experience and knowledge, I see an issue in the question that needs to be resolved before someone attempts an answer, and if comments seem unlikely to be effective.</p>
<p>One exception is if there are already four close votes on a post. In that scenario, I believe moderators can vote from the perspectives of a regular user. Since by that stage, a fifth vote from a moderator functions just like a vote from any regular user.</p>
<p>In all cases with legitimate, good faith participants, I believe it is the responsibility of moderators to ensure guidance has been offered on the closed questions.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>My response will depend on the specific situation. For excessive arguments, I will first move them to chat and then delete all further attempts to argue in the comments. If they're flagged for incivility, I will manually edit the comment to remove the offending passage if the rest of the comment contains value, or delete the entire comment if not.</p>
<p>In all cases, my modus operandi has been to contact the user directly to ask them to improve their behavior, and escalate from that if the warnings proved insufficient. While I believe we should value everyone who produce content, no one user is irreplaceable, and maintaining an overall positive, friendly environment is more important than any single power user.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe this should be resolved in the mod chat room. Ideally we will come to an agreement, which we always have in the past. If an agreement is not forthcoming, I believe in asking the rest of the mod team for input.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start=""4"">
<li>In your opinion, what do moderators do?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from our janitorial duties with regards to the trolls and bots, I believe the primary function of a moderator is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set an example for other users</li>
<li>Provide guidance and assistance to users on how to use this site</li>
<li>Facilitate consensus formation on Meta and mediate disputes</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm always humbled by the responsibility, and I hope I have conducted myself in a manner that befits the diamond.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My feeling is that the diamond gives more weight when I offer advice to new users. History.SE has a somewhat high bar for entry because of our high standards for questions, and because history is a topic where questions are often dependent on contextual knowledge. Even though we now have several message templates that do a great job of summarising how this site works for a new user, I feel a more personalised guidance is often beneficial.</p>
<p>In addition, aside from the ability to quickly respond to trolls and incivility, moderator privileges also gives me more ability to maintain the tag system.</p>

&quot;<em>Is there more modern history book with the same scope as Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire? [closed]</em>.  This is an interesting question, and the original poster was very cooperative in editing it to try to get within H:SE guidelines.  Several of us discussed ways that we might alter the question to avoid closure and/or to provide a useful answer.</p>
<p>I'd summarize the question with two themes - first that the question is too broad, and second that the question is fundamentally <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/09/29/good-subjective-bad-subjective/"">bad subjective</a>.   The question is good; I wouldn't mind knowing the answer myself.  But H:SE isn't the right place to ask that question.  There is probably another forum where the question is more likely to get a useful answer.</p>
<p>Not every question is appropriate for H:SE; that doesn't mean they are bad questions, just that they aren't appropriate for the venue.  I'm hesitant about offering an analogy, but there are some conversations I'd have in a noisy nightclub, other conversations that belong over an intimate dinner table, and still others that can be carried out in a sacred space.  Starting the right conversation in the wrong space will be suboptimal.</p>
<p>I want to compliment the several people who offered constructive suggestions in comments.  I am not fond of comments, but I have grown to like our custom of offering constructive answers in comments in response to questions with challenges.  I like the notion that we can be helpful even when we're unable to be fully responsive.</p>
<p>I'm going to mark this community wiki, and hope that we can use it as a reference. It is difficult to explain &quot;good question wrong venue&quot; in the limited space available in a comment.

Moderator votes are binding. Any place we have voting — close, open, delete, undelete, offensive, migration, etc — that vote will reach the threshold and take effect immediately if a single moderator casts a vote.</p>
<hr />
<p>The <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/124106/437864"">general advice to moderators</a> is:</p>
<p>When you see a post you think should be closed, close it.  When you see a post you think should be re-opened, re-open it.  If you're not sure, don't do either.  We've entrusted you with the ability to perform both of those tasks instantly - so use them judiciously.</p>
<p>Clearly, obvious troll posts and spam should be closed (and deleted) immediately.  However, the question of whether posts should be closed is not always that clear.  In recent years, moderators on History:SE have generally used a lighter touch, and preferred (where possible) to allow the community to decide.</p>
<hr>   
<p>(1.) So where do you think the line should be drawn?.  <strong>How proactive do you think moderators should be in closing posts which may be <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">off-topic</a>, based on the criteria in our help centre?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it is at all a judgement call, I think its important that diamond mods allow the users of the site a chance to make that judgement. This allows the site's vision of itself to evolve with its users, and gives users a sense of ownership in the site's mission.</p>
<p>However, there is some content that is objectively, indisputably off-topic (aka: &quot;garbage&quot;<sup>*</sup>), there's no good reason for such a post to hang out waiting for enough high-rep users to notice it. There is also (not as rare as we'd like) content that is actively damaging for users to see, such as personal abuse or generalized bigotry, and the quicker that's deleted, the better for everyone.</p>
<p>Sadly, due to our subject matter and the state of the world today, a large part of this job ends up being deleting Nazi posts. Of course the bright side of that is that a moderator on History gets to (metaphorically) destroy Nazis.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not a robot, or a computer. If you're a longtime user on this site, I care for you, and if you start becoming a problem for other users, I want you to do better, and you will probably get more consideration from me than someone who pops onto this site fresh and immediately starts being a problem.</p>
<p>Is this a bit of a failing as a moderator? Possibly. That's for you as a voter to decide. This is why I'm very glad to have had a team of moderators of varying dispositions with me who can backstop me if I am worried I'm being too lenient with a user. I think we have done a stellar job of talking out issues and listening to each other when making difficult moderation decisions like this, I hope that tradition continues after the election, no matter what the selected group looks like.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>As touched on in the previous answer, we have a private moderator chat, where such things are tactfully hashed out. I will generally bring up what issue I might have with a decision there, but always with the attitude that this is just my perspective. Likely as not I'm wrong, or more often there is no <em>right</em>, just trade-offs. If we all have a roughly common understanding of the trade-offs involved in decisions, and how we'd like them prioritized for the site, then we can trust each other to moderate, even if I know someone is likely to be much quicker to close a post than I would be. That difference doesn't have to be a problem, it can be a <em>strength</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start=""4"">
<li>In your opinion, what do moderators do?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>At the core, I feel like we are the site janitors. We are here to clean up the messes that other users cannot.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start=""5"">
<li>A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>When I first became a moderator, I was surprised about what a big deal this was. And to be honest, I'm kind of not a fan. Getting a critical comment from someone with a diamond next to their name carries something akin to an implied threat, which means moderators have to be very careful when they comment.</p>
<p>There are plusses to this as well though. A new user getting a kind suggestion from a diamond mod (assuming they aren't so new that they don't know what that means) can have a whole lot more impact than the same words from anyone else. A comment thread that has wandered off into problematic territory can often be calmed down with a stern reminder of site standards from a diamond mod. (Not always of course, but it does happen).</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start=""6"">
<li>In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I think I've covered a lot of this territory in #5 above, but there is one further thing not covered elsewhere: comments. Comments can be an immense help to a post, or the thing that causes the whole site to descend into drama and acrimony.</p>
<p>I've made an oft-repeated post that <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3627/when-comments-are-flagged-are-related-comments-looked-at-by-moderators/3631#3631"">comments are our barn cats</a>. However, I also feel that good comments can make or break a post. Site moderators are the only users (outside of each comment's author) who can delete or edit comments, and this function I feel is vital to keeping the site running smoothly.</p>

Some time ago I posted a question which was almost immediately closed and flagged as &quot;too basic&quot; with a literal suggestion I go elsewhere for the info.</p>
<p>I posted a question about this incident on the <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4155/who-decides-whether-a-question-is-too-basic-and-dont-you-think-that-is-counte"">meta</a> and the answers were quite good (and there were other similar questions) but also somewhat at odds and hence I am asking for clarification from the next group of candidates.</p>
<p>I came here from Stack Overflow and don't recall ever seeing a post there labeled as &quot;too basic&quot;. Because they answer questions both easy and difficult, often multiple times, they are extremely valuable and the first place to go for answers to virtually ANY question related to computer programming (and other computer-related topics). All are welcome there, newbies and pros alike and, as a result, they are the most popular website in my industry from my vantage point.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, I am still unclear about this site's mission. Do you want people to come here first to answer their questions or head to wikipedia instead? What is your position on the casual history buff? What about a 4th grader who wants to know what life was like when his grandfather served on a destroyer? Or maybe a high school student trying to put together a paper on the great depression?</p>
<p>In short, is your mission to be more like StackOverflow or something intended more for the historical hoi oligoi?</p>

As usual, one should of course start with a site's personalized <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">help On-Topic page</a>.</p>
<p>Since this question particularly asked about our &quot;Too Basic&quot; close reason, perhaps you'll be interested in <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4155/who-decides-whether-a-question-is-too-basic-and-dont-you-think-that-is-counte"">my answer to this question about it two months ago</a> , which itself contains a couple of links showing how we arrived at that one. The bit I'll repeat here is that the wording of that close reason was probably, in retrospect, a bit of a mistake. Particularly the use of the word &quot;basic&quot;. However, there are a limited number of close reasons available, and changing one is kind of a big production, so minor language tweaks are probably not feasible.</p>
<p>The other thing I'd mention here is that different SE sites are different. Probably <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/4166/771"">one of closest in function to us is Skeptics</a>, but there are minor differences that cause major differences in how our two sites have to be run. Given that, expecting us to operate identically to a radically different site like StackExchange is obviously (as my Brit friends would say) Right Out.</p>
<p>Generally the best thing to do when you hop onto a new SE site is lurk for a while. Failing that (eg: you just wanted a question answered, and we seemed the most appropriate SE site), listen to criticisms of your posts from high-rep users, and expect to have to learn a thing or two. I know sometimes that isn't fun, because I get to go through it every now and then when I post a question on a new site where I don't have a lot of rep and a diamond next to my name.</p>

<p>I recently asked a question on History SE. In that question I did some prior research, and found a paper with what seemed like a close-to-complete answer.</p>
<p>But I still thought that the question was worth asking, because I didn't have the expertise to determine whether the paper I found was missing out on something important, whether it reflected the historical consensus, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTRKCXC0JFg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">whether it didn't mean what I thought it meant</a>, etc.</p>
<p>So I asked the question. Because of that one paper, I thought that I had done enough prior research. However, based on community discussions, I think I have come up with a guideline and I am wondering whether you agree with it:</p>
<p><strong>When asking whether a particular source conclusively answers a particular question, I should almost always try to include multiple sources in the question.</strong></p>
<p>The idea would be that this would a) demonstrate that the question is non-trivial if the two sources disagree, b) give people answering the question a starting point for tackling at least some of the issues in evaluating any sources that may be out there.</p>

<p>It surely wasn't a 'defacing' as I took care to not change anything else in the post.
A casual reader will not see any differences or any changes made to that post at all.
Despite some more typos for example that also would still need improvement.
Even in the revision view only one of three viewing options makes those comments visible.
A plus side to this would be that the OP as well as anyone else editing that post would read it and then decide to be responsive to that content or not. In the latter case with the fast and easy option of a relatively painless rollback.</p>
<p>Therefore the rationale for it is that this is still a friendly edit.
An edit that should give hints to improve the post.
And as the canned edit rejection phrases it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This edit was intended to address the author of the post and makes no sense as an edit. It should have been written as a comment or an answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The edit I made addresses the <em>content of the post</em>, which I thought was largely unresponsive to the question posed, too weak in the arguments presented, with some grievous errors or falsehoods, and in the parts that do present a direct response it ignores the actual evidence already present in the question by just stating an unreferenced 'false'.</p>
<p>Couple this with expressed intent of the answer to just complement the question, as this user thought the question itself, which already got complaints for being ugh-tooo-looong, to include more background info. Info which by its very nature in this case might be interesting to know for non-Berliners in general, but not really relevant for the question asked.</p>
<p>The answer also engages in a contradictory meta-discussion:</p>
<p>&quot;For these reasons I casted the second vote to close this question as Opion-based.&quot; which is evidently so non sequitur that it still prompts OP to then go on to post an opinion based answer. Still filled with the intent to accuse the author of the question as narrow minded and either pushing a position or asking in bad faith, as apparently 'evidenced' that the question post was too short and supposedly ignored the small French origin minority from some time earlier than the time frame asked about.</p>
<p>To repeat that: my question presented an observed pattern of language policy that left out one particular spot to fill. The question asks for the discussions at the time as to why there was some exception made. We see from the question that the exact wording in question was under attack from 1801 but the medal itself seen with a really special status even in 1934. Now that 1934 data point is a tiny hint with indeed the help of a reference in the answer under discussion, alas wholly dismissed by OP.</p>
<p>The close votes the question attracted for being allegedly &quot;opinion based&quot; are hard to follow. &quot;Low quality&quot; was now another reason given here on meta by OP.</p>
<p>Just because a simple net search doesn't give you the direct answer? Wikipedia links don't spell out the answer? The question is difficult to answer, as some of the most relevant books are not online:
Stephen Thomas Previtera: &quot;Prussian Blue: A History of the Order Pour Le Merite&quot;, 2005.<br />
David Edkins: &quot;The Prussian Orden Pour Le Mérite: History of the Blue Max&quot;, 1981.</p>
<p>The perceived by me need <em>to improve the answer</em> is a really rather large one. Adding just <em>a</em> comment is not enough for comment length restrictions and further made difficult for the surely ensuing discussion style, with a pattern of then receiving a response that will be argumentative and with a ratio of one comment generating another three or more as responses that are often filled up with 'me is right and you are wrong' or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My statement is correct, yours is false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looked at from the other side: how should one rectify such problems as 'Liberty fries and Liberty cabbage'? While being an 'American thing' one is a century after the inquired time frame, the other the exact same pattern to observe. Some policy results in attempts to change the language in seemingly simple words. OP dismisses both of these far away incidences in another language and polity but just links to the fries, where that propaganda stint didn't catch on outside of jokes with a reference to Wikipedia. Had he done that with a link to the cabbage than the whole circumstantial argument breaks down, as 'liberty cabbage' did catch on <em>much</em> better for a time. For the purpose of the question this is quite secondary, as it is the reasons and arguments exchanged at the time that are being asked for, not just some random 21st century SE user's opinion. I'll stop listing even more examples from the question on main for the purpose of returning to 'purpose of inline comments and proper use'</p>
<p>As per SE model: From the long list of flaws and errors in that answer that I tried to fix I included some counterarguments into the question itself. By incorporating some evidence I try to preempt that these mere assertions and tangential reasonings are not enough and even clearly contradicted by prior research in the question.</p>
<p>But how should anyone improve further a question that is met with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your own quote answers your own question: The aim was to replace foreign words with German expressions. Words not names. Had they wanted to change everything French, they would have done it then. But they didn't. Sorry, but this is wishful thinking on your part.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Names&quot; are not &quot;words&quot;? &quot;Had they wanted to change everything French, they would have done it then.&quot; – I give evidence of a century long struggle with small steps of achievement and defeat, a process with ups and downs, many arguments exchanged, then get greeted with a nonsensical 'common sense' comment that is proven wrong in the text of the question itself, with hard evidence and primary source quotes – yet the comment is still upvoted?</p>
<p>In light of this I chose the alternative to proceed as it presented itself to me, as repeated from the canned rejection response:</p>
<p>Address the author 'with a comment'. In this case an <em>inline comment</em> invisible to the casual reader.</p>
<p>It is not my intention to attack the author or deface that post, however much I really do disagree with most of its content. Those 4014 characters added are not made in or for fun and are meant as an invitation to fix what's wrong with the post.</p>
<p>If &quot;should be a comment&quot; really unexpectedly for me excludes 'inline comments' – it was one attempt to find a solution to the problems of content and form discussed above – then I'll just stop.</p>

<p>A fine balance must exist to ensure that a system can envolve (without getting out of control). A too strict interpretation by one (or more) could lead to a stagnation <strong>or</strong> giving the impression that only certain topic are allowed.</p>
<p>Part of this is that eligible users should be able to close a question, so preemptive closing should be avoided in non urgent cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>leeway in areas that may overlap as long as the main context is within what one consiered to be the main topic</li>

<p>Note that you debate in your example a comment with a comment. While comments should 'improve a post' (semaphore's does this, yours not). If your other comments were of the same kind, then I guess that <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3627/when-comments-are-flagged-are-related-comments-looked-at-by-moderators"">'comments are like barncats'</a> is more fitting than anything else? Comments are all volatile. Unless you could point to deleted things more 'substantial for improving the post – and still relevant', then my guess is that an answer to this is probably 'not much' (and shouldn't).</p>
<p>To which you responded in an update to your question:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>While comments should 'improve a post' (semaphore's does this, yours not).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What about your comment here? How does it improve my question? Rules for thee but not for me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I can relate to your frustration of writing something up that then  vanishes by getting deleted, such a fate is really <em>common for comments</em> and not even unheard of for answers. Now that I lifted my comment to which you responded here to an answer box, I increased its chance of survival. Well, I hope so ;). <em>Answers</em> are our first class citizens, comments are not. Improvements for that system may be needed, but most I can think of need to be requested at the system design level at MetaSE.</p>
<p>Those that might be addressed by <em>our policy</em> on comment moderation and how it played out so far for your experience seem to be:</p>
<p>To be fair, indeed I wanted to jot down with that comment a quick response to make you feel heard and less frustrated. While what I wrote is technically also a half-answer – not strictly according to policy, and indeed intended by as such, and still in all too great danger of getting deleted – my 'improvement' part should have been this encouragement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unless you could point to deleted things more 'substantial for improving the post – and still relevant'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meaning: yeah, having your writings deleted does seldom feel very nice, but is a common 'feature' this comment system offers <em>and</em> that under these circumstances – which I am not all too privy to know anything detailed about, they were deleted after all and it's not even easy to figure out which original posts you refer to here – that I recommended to you to make <em>this meta post</em> more accessible and strengthen your point.</p>
<p>So far I haven't been shown here a deleted comment that fulfilled what I would consider 'yeah, should have been left visible, for now'. Do that and I would probably agree and sustain that a comment may have been deleted 'too early' (but see below on why I certainly do not think that there are 'all comments worth preserving for eternity'). I am pretty sure our mods have deleted some comments that should have been up longer, mistakes happen, opinions differ. But in the case as presented I do not agree for the deleted comments to be that important as to constitute a reason of too much concern.</p>
<p>My opinion on that would change if you would point here to some deleted comment on Main like your allusion to a 'Stalin post' — <em>but only</em> if that comment would have been deleted while the big flaw it criticised would be left unfixed. Now that the flaw the comment pointed out is fixed, the comment served its purpose, and may be deleted, or even better should be deleted. Whether by yourself, by mods that read it directly, or anyone flagging it with the canned reason of &quot;no longer needed&quot;.</p>
<p>So you did find a very relevant comment, that stayed up for quite a while, and alas also was sadly needed for too long a time. Now that the answer was edited, it may be gone anytime. Why not flag it as 'no longer needed'?</p>
<p>To be clear: I haven't voted either way on your post here. In my opinion – and that's even a little exceptional to 'established by design policy' – some comments are desperately needed <em>to stay</em> below a post. In my opinion those are of the kind: 'adding substantial info' (that should be incorporated into the main post eventually; 'pointing out serious flaws' (of the <em>post</em> they are directed at, and then either taken as base for editing the post or as a reminder of <em>caveat emptor</em> for future readers), etc.</p>
<p>My opinion of 'some comments deserve to stay' quickly diminishes for comments that react to other comments, and that is even evaporating quicker if those sidelined discussions start to devolve away from the original post. These are then maybe interesting, and in my view not forbidden to post, but it is also not guaranteed that they have any right to stay. To the contrary. It is long standing policy that comments are intended for a very specific purpose:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/comment""><strong>When should I comment?</strong></a></p>
<p>You should submit a comment if you want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request clarification from the author;</li>
<li>Leave constructive criticism that guides the author in improving the post;</li>
<li>Add relevant but minor or transient information to a post (e.g. a link to a related question, or an alert to the author that the question has been updated).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When shouldn't I comment?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Comments are not recommended for any of the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Suggesting corrections that don't fundamentally change the meaning of the post; instead, make or suggest an edit;</li>
<li>Answering a question or providing an alternate solution to an existing answer; instead, post an actual answer (or edit to expand an existing one);</li>
<li>Compliments which do not add new information (&quot;+1, great answer!&quot;); instead,
upvote it and pay it forward;</li>
<li>Criticisms which do not add anything constructive (&quot;-1, see previous comments you scallywag!&quot;); instead, downvote (and provide or upvote a better answer if appropriate);</li>
<li>Secondary discussion or debating a controversial point; please use chat instead;</li>
<li>Discussion of community behavior or site policies; please use meta instead.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And from the beginning of that page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are comments?</p>
<p><em><strong>Comments are temporary</strong></em> &quot;Post-It&quot; notes left on a question or answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When one of my comments I think of course relevant but maybe minor gets deleted I am mostly concerned about any OP having read and understood the content. 'Others' are seldom an audience to cater for and upvotes on comments pretty meaningless in most circumstances.</p>
<p>That said, a pretty big problem seems to arise from what I increasingly tend to read out of the chosen title for this question: &quot;self-serving censorship by moderators&quot;.</p>
<p>Why &quot;self-serving&quot;?<br />
I can't help it but read that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>noticed that my comments that are in any way contradicting statements by [mod] get deleted without a trace (not just moved to chat),</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as 'I had an <em>argument <strong>in comments</strong></em> with a mod, and the mod deleted <em>only my superior comments</em> so that he/his would look better'.<br />
If that's indeed the case, the comments are just the wrong form altogether for the intended purpose.<br />
Maybe I am wrong on how to generalise a formula for this, but unless a deleted comment that reacts to another comment is itself still directly relevant for the original post, I see little reason when such a digressing comment vanishes for the posting user to get too much worked up about it.</p>
<p>I hope that wasn't all too demotivational.</p>
<p>Don't stop in trying to improve the site or the posts on it.</p>
<p>Don't stay upset about a minor comment if that comment doesn't stay up.</p>

<h2>The deleted answer and its quality</h2>
<p>There is this well researched, amply referenced, and dotted with examples and quotes, truthful answer that addresses the question as asked, in much detail.</p>
<p>It does this with <em>the</em> most relevant source in book form plus explanations, scientific as well as political and historical.</p>
<p>We see nine upvotes on it, and that it was accepted by OP.</p>
<p>We also see it deleted.</p>
<h2>The deletion process timeline</h2>
<p>One delete vote from long ago that never aged away from a user that himself edited the answer much to my dislike into a shape that attracted via timeline the majority of downvotes.</p>
<p>Two more recent delete-votes from users who in the past repeatedly professed to be not into reading long answers.</p>
<p>None of the delete votes seem to conform to the criteria set forth in the documentation 'when should a user cast deletion votes'.</p>
<h2>Deplatforming attacks on the question</h2>
<p>Via timeline for the question we see also that the question itself is valid enough to be open now. But as well that it was under a deplatforming attack from users who do not want the topic existing at all. One of those previous deplatforming close votes coming from one of the answer delete voters.</p>
<p>That leaves a direct answer hidden from view and an existing answer in place that really isn't a complete and self-reliant answer at all, but merely a comment and expansion to the deleted answer.</p>
<h2>Quality of deleted answer as per reactions in comments and chat</h2>
<p>One comment below the deleted answer is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's unfortunate that your answer starts in such a provocative way. Had you replaced the first few paragraphs with something more neutral, to the effect of &quot;vaccines weren't as safe as they are now&quot; you'd never have had such a high number of downvotes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is indeed unfortunate. If current day activists and propagandists want fallaciously to 'appeal to consequences' <em>now</em> on an upvoted and accepted answer… that's telling! But not in a good way. It's not 'healthy' for the site.</p>
<p>Another comment shows the utmost of ignorance in refusal to read through the actual answer. It says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this is a fringe theory that is not accepted by the scientific mainstream. As a result, this is heavily downvoted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Fringe theory&quot;? When quoting medical authorities like the CDC, or mainstream historians on the very subject matter like Stanley Williamson: &quot;The Vaccination Controversy. The rise, reign and fall of compulsory vaccination for smallpox&quot;, Liverpool University Press? That's really ridiculous and a clear sign of not bothering to read but jumping down into the comment section to vent unsubstantiated opinions.</p>
<p>And the quite happy first comment on it was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Excellent quote from Durbach, thanks. The low quality of free vaccinations is an eye-opener.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sidenote for those accusations about any 'agendas'; the still standing and upvoted but isolated half-answer in response and as comment to the deleted one says about the deleted one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/54872/47672"">I think <strong>the other answer though factually fair</strong> is a…</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And another comment is clearly incomprehensible as it is one major point in the argument presented in the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can't help it, but for me that picture of the &quot;horrible side effects of smallpox vaccination&quot; is virtually indistinguishable from a picture of a smallpox victim...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, yeah, exactly the point. Ordinary people do not see much difference – and then conclude that smallpox vaccinations are maybe not as safe for them as propagandists always claim.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps this really accomplishes something. For lay people this is, and now image 19th century people delivering their child to the station, get a scar under dreadful conditions then return home being sick from whatever, but even worse: the younger sibling looking like this 2 weeks later. What would your own conclusion be? And you see from the colour that this is a more recent picture. (But thx for headsup, forgot to link outside alt-tag)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which the detractor simply doubles down with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wish I could give more downvotes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For explaining historical facts, medical facts, psychological and sociological explanations, all referenced? This looks like someone in some denial.</p>
<p>Yet another comment correctly concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer is well researched and documented. This is what should be taken into account while voting for answers. Whether someone perceives the answer as being pro or against vaccines is neither here not there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet that's all we see from a certain subset of users here.</p>
<p>The fallacy of judging a <em>historical</em> answer by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_consequences"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">'appealing to consequences'</a> for contemporary present day politics agendas is even made quite explicit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But when taking into account the risk of contagion when not vaccinated, as well as the effect of people refusing vaccination on principle when we as human society are trying to erradicate a disease (and hence the need for vaccination in future generations), summarizing as (boldface) &quot;vaccinations are dangerous&quot; is misleading at best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that's not what I call <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_ira_et_studio"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>sine ira et studio.</em></a></p>
<h2>Dealing with criticism, whether valid or invalid, and the H:SE catch-22 of resolving disputed content</h2>
<p>The answer was criticised heavily. With debating comments challenging any unreferenced claims they didn't like as 'untrue', 'misleading'.</p>
<p>The proper way of dealing with such allegations is a) correcting the content, b) removing the wrong content if allegations are true or c) <em><strong>proving</strong></em> <em>them</em> <em><strong>untrue</strong></em>.<br />
With proof and evidence in the form of quotes and references from reputable sources.<br />
Which I did. Everything written and challenged is backed up. We see the data, we see the experts, we see the sources.</p>
<p>What else can an historical answer provide than going <em>ad fontes</em> and contextualising this with other expert opinions? The detractors below that deleted answer don't have a leg to stand on, when they apparently want to try to answer 'why was it discontinued' with 'people were all stupid back then', or 'evil did triumph once more'. This kind of moralising judgement is the very opposite of what historical research, or really any kind of research should do.</p>
<h2>The style of discussion in comments, chat and on meta</h2>
<p>Further, I'd like to voice my concerns here about an active subset of the community that places their personal feelings and perceived moral obligations before historical research and results.</p>
<p>This is a phenomenon now seen quite a bit too often already. It is quite unnerving to so often see cries of 'biased' and 'untrue' in comments below posts from users who cannot properly backup their most often than not unsourced opinions.</p>
<p>From the post under discussion here we see at least 5 users <em>not reading</em> what is written. Consequently misunderstanding, some quite wilfully, what the answer says.</p>
<p>Jumping to the comments without reading a post is quite senseless. Voting on a post without reading it is senseless. It needs to stop. The built-in technical limitation for a post is 30000 characters. Anyone who wants to complain about that needs to vent on MetaSE and not below posts that use this provision. Preferably on the post were Shog9 requests this limit even to be raised?</p>
<h2>Keeping it deleted?</h2>
<p>The above means that I see no reason for that post to remain deleted. Especially not when compared to all those other posts, like those without any necessary references of more often than not more questionable quality.</p>
<p>Simply a net negative score surely cannot be the only reason to delete such an answer?</p>
<p>Some contention arose from sheer length, which I consider a wholly invalid complaint altogether, and always. On that topic specifically many benign sources like Wikipedia also presents any reader coming along with unpleasant pictures. Disputed facts are properly referenced. Among them the much controversy provoking 'magic word' &quot;dangerous&quot;, which coincidently appears all the time in the <em>quoted</em> quality references, whether from relevant primary sources at the time or later historical depictions, or *current medical expert opinion. Whether it is the best word here or not will remain a matter of personal opinion of readers. And one magic word should not be sufficient reason to delete an answer.</p>
<p>Given that most of the downvotes obviously – and in part also documented by comments – came from campaigning <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deplatforming"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">deplatformers</a>, and that one delete vote came from a once agreeing editor that never aged away and the next two were from knee-jerk no-readers, I'd like to suggest to the community to undelete a well referenced answer that directly answers the question with some of the best available sources, which was upvoted nine times and accepted by the asker.</p>

<h1>After time for contemplation, deliberation, and only two meagre voices on this here in answers: undelete now!</h1>
<p>Taken together, this looks pretty much like a plain wrongful deletion, against policy, not meeting required criteria as outlined in for example  our help-center or meta.stackexchange.com/q/5221</p>
<p>Even after inquiry here so far no valid criteria warranting deletion came forward. Instead we saw – still after editing by mod for politeness and operational focus – personalised attacks on 'style' and 'being no asset', &quot;verbal diarrhea&quot;, &quot;very little is&quot; (<a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Reputation&amp;filter=quarter"">compare</a> with who's posting the insults here).</p>
<p>&quot;Too long&quot; isn't one, the deleted answer is not campaigning anything (unlike commentators and del-voters) and <em>it does answer the question</em>, with facts, referencess, sources, quotes. All of them of high quality, again contra accusations of any 'agenda'.</p>
<p>It should be undeleted at once, because the deletion voters and process itself failed the policy of meeting the required criteria to cast a deserved delete vote.</p>

<p>The answer lacks a structure that leads to a final conclusion that answers the question.</p>
<p>The quality of the answer would be improved, if it could be structured in a similar mannor as this answer from the same author:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/54274/38607"">Why in most German places is the church the tallest building?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In its present form, it is only a collection of quotes.</p>
<h3>Objectivity of answer</h3>
<p>The author <strong>indoctrination</strong> style of writing, not for the first time, makes itself noticeable.
The third link leads to a dictionary definition of the word <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dangerous"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dangerous</a>, afterwhich every use of the word <strong>danger</strong> is set to bold to insure that everyone gets the message:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vaccinations <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1035155094954164671"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">are</a> <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dangerous"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dangerous</a>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The link for <strong>are</strong> leads to a paywall protected article, where only the first part can be seen and also contains a quote from Anthony S. Fauci:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The topic of his talk was bioterror, but the unsettling show-and-tell wasn't focused on the threat of smallpox: it addressed the serious risks of the vaccine meant to prevent it. &quot;<strong>These are things the American public needs to understand</strong>,&quot; said the speaker, Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sub><a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1035155094954164671"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2002-10-02: Ugly Side Effects of Vaccine For Smallpox Color Planning<br>The Wall Street Journal</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>giving the impression that <em>Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</em> also thinks that <strong>Vaccinations are dangerous</strong>.</p>
<p>The rest of the answer pushes an <strong>anti-vaccinationists</strong> agenda with no alternative opinion being offered as if they don't exist.</p>
<p>A quick search, however, results in an article  (also from <em>Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</em>) in <strong>The New England Journal of Medicine</strong>.</p>
<p>The message here, however, is completely different:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within this group, smallpox stands out because of its ease of transmissibility, its high mortality rate, and its established ability to ravage populations. There is a relative lack of immunity against smallpox in the population, and the <strong>thought of a smallpox epidemic instills terror in nearly everyone</strong>.<br />
...<br />
Because people of good intentions disagree on government policy regarding smallpox vaccination in the context of a bioterrorist threat, <strong>the general public must understand</strong> the decision-making process as well as the rationale behind decisions that may affect their health and their lives.</p>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3>Conclusions about answer</h3>
<p>This is an opinionated answer that doesn't actually answer the question.</p>
<p>Even if this answer was rewritten to explain the reasons behind the <strong>anti-vaccinationists</strong> agenda (which would at least be a historical topic), it would be off-topic due to the question being: <em>Why was compulsory vaccination abandoned in the UK?</em>.</p>
<p>As to the author complaints (stated in this question and the comments in the original answer) about the reactions of the other users, they are really not justified considering how he reacts to other peaple's answers when he disagrees:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4200/misuse-of-edit-privilege-when-op-fills-answer-with-inline-comments-they-dont-ag"">Misuse of edit privilege when OP fills answer with inline comments they don't agree to? - History Meta Stack Exchange</a></li>
</ul>
<p>and elsewhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Further, I'd like to voice my concerns here about an active subset of the community that places their personal feelings and perceived moral obligations before historical research and results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author is really <strong>the last person</strong> on this site that should make such a complaint</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Do unto others as you would have them do unto you</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I consider the removal of the answer as justified.</p>

Addressing these in order:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em><strong>Fair use</strong></em> of copyright materials is not a blanket excuse for taking all and every bit of material from someone else's work. One of the quotes in that answer is 14 paragraphs long with a truly minimal use of elision. Quotes should not be used as the basis of the arguments presented; rather they should provide the facts upon which the author - <em><strong>themselves and no-one else</strong></em> - argues the case being made.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The failure to use elision in any meaningful sense means that rather than highlighting points, the long quotes are nothing more than extensive rabbit holes which users must dig themselves out of before attempting comprehension of anything written or argued. They don't strengthen points, but detract from them by making them incomprehensible. They are mere verbal diarrhea, a regurgitation of others' work that simply makes a mess to be cleaned up before continued reading can progress; and nothing more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I sincerely hope these comments will be taken as they are intended: a wake-up call to improve the author's writing. They clearly put considerable effort into writing answers - but the resultant quality does not come anywhere near deserving of that effort. Their posts could be a real asset to this site - but in my opinion very little of it to date is.</p>

<ol>
<li>Your question has <strong>not</strong> been marked as a duplicate. Some users have merely suggested it to be one.</li>
<li>The other question was not &quot;downvoted into closing&quot; - <strong>downvotes cannot do this.</strong> It was closed because the claim that Hungarians were Turks seems disproven by basic research.</li>
</ol>
<p>In my opinion, these two questions are not actually duplicates. The other question is focused on the veracity of claims for a Turkish origin for Hungarians and Bulgarians, while yours is a more open question asking about Bulgarian ethnogenesis.</p>
<p>However, there's a good answer on the other question, that also answers your question. It is, I think, a bit of a shame to let it languish on a closed question. Likewise, your question has received a good answer as well, that we wouldn't want to go to waste.</p>
<p>This makes marking these two questions as duplicates an unattracting option, in my view.</p>
<p>I therefore agree that a merge may be the best option. Since the other question has been closed and by all appearances abandoned, while yours demonstrate much greater effort as befitting of History.SE's current standards, I have merged the old question into yours.</p>

<p>The malicious actor is pretending to be a &quot;Professional Photographer&quot;

addresses and providing different fake phone numbers (generally with a
'718' area code).</p>
<p>Once the recipient clicks the link it will take them to a file

<ul>
<li>All the sentences ending with a <code>?</code> are talking about the actions and behaviors of Islamic-controlled areas of Al-Andulus, which that tag was designed to cover.</li>
<li>That tag also covers <em>Almoravid</em>-controlled parts of the peninsula, which was mentioned in the 2nd paragraph to provide the required contrast for a relative concept (intolerance).</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this question is legitimately tagged <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/spain"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;spain&#39;"" rel=""tag"">spain</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contrast is also made with the Aragon-Castilian Alhambra Decree.</li>
<li>Spain is mentioned 3 times in the first paragraph.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are arguably weaker reasons, but tags do get thrown onto questions for weaker reasons sometimes.</p>
<p>Things that would <em>not</em> be good reasons to tag the question with <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/spain"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;spain&#39;"" rel=""tag"">spain</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the specific places mentioned (eg: Toledo) eventually became Spanish territory.</li>
<li>Some of the of the territory of Al Andulus eventually became Spanish territory.</li>
</ul>
<p>If those two were the only reasons, then I'd agree that the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/spain"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;spain&#39;"" rel=""tag"">spain</a> tag perhaps should be removed too. This goes for any other country tags that might today cover some territory that used to be part of Al Andulus, but wasn't otherwise mentioned in the question, such as <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/portugal"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;portugal&#39;"" rel=""tag"">portugal</a> and <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/morocco"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;morocco&#39;"" rel=""tag"">morocco</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>An astute person might notice there's an inherent principle in here I'm glossing over, which is that I don't think <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/spain"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;spain&#39;"" rel=""tag"">spain</a> should be used geographically. Its probably OK to talk about an area that was at the time ruled by a state that later <em>became</em> Spain (like Aragon or Castile), because there were a few of those and making tags for them all probably wouldn't be feasible.</p>
<p>If this means that we ought to have something like <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iberan-peninsula"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;iberan-peninsula&#39;"" rel=""tag"">iberan-peninsula</a> to cover the need for a geographic term, well I don't think I'd argue against it.

<p>As we say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new one, we have <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=%22year+in+moderation%22+is%3Aquestion"">a tradition of sharing moderation stats for the past 12 months</a>.</p>
<p>As most of you here are aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.<br />
-- <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"">A Theory of Moderation</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't eliminate the need for having <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/"">moderators</a> altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.</p>
<p>So as we welcome 2021, and in keeping with tradition, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pU1Al.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>exciting</em> stats</a>.

<p>³ A &quot;destroyed&quot; user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user"">Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.</a></p>
<p>⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.</p>
<p>⁵ Includes close flags (but <em>not</em> close or reopen votes).</p>
<p>⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.</p>

I'd like to propose a change to the way we handle those questions.  I'm going to quickly summarize the protocol, then I'll explain why, and then I'll finish by listing some qualms that I would appreciate community help in resolving.</p>
<h1>Proposed protocol</h1>
<p>When moderators spot a question that we predict will be closed, particularly if that question is from a new user, we will pre-emptively close the question, make some quick edits and then force a re-open. (mod-hammer-close, mod-edit and mod-hammer RO)   If we're not sure that the edit is quite right, we'll skip the third step and post a comment asking the community to 1) recognize this as a new user, 2) Improve the edit, and/or 3) vote to re-open.</p>
<p>Naturally this is a selective protocol; P. Geerkens correctly points out that some closures are righteous.  I think there are some questions where this protocol would help.</p>
<h1>Why: Problem statement(s)</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>We have a finicky culture. I support that culture; it has evolved in response to our needs and I defend it, but it isn't easy for an outsider to grasp quickly.  That is one of the reasons I drop the standard comment on so many questions - to provide guidance to resources that will help people to acclimate to H:SE.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We close fast.  This is really a SE problem; it has been analyzed elsewhere (I'd be grateful to someone for a relevant link; feel free to edit it in here), but closure is what we call a &quot;trapdoor function&quot; - it is easier to close a question than to re-open it.  (Even though the protocol should make it easier to re-open than close, empirical evidence says that closure is more frequent than re-open.)  P. Geerkens (correctly) points out that some questions should be closed fast and left closed.  Some questions cannot/should not be saved.  I guess I'm hoping that some fraction of them could be saved.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The theory (Again, I'd appreciate a link) that closure should lead to an edit/remediation cycle, which should result in a re-opened, significantly better question.  Empirical evidence says that closure is final, and that the new user is unlikely to return.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We have an anti-pattern where people will post a well intentioned partial answer to a flawed question; the question gets edited, the answer is now less relevant; this leads to multiple edits to fix one side or the other.  Nobody is satisfied with the result.  If we close first, edit to quality and <em>then</em> answer, I think we can get to a mutually happy place.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is my impression that we have trouble keeping new users. One of my goals is to be more welcoming to, and more retentive of new users.  I'd rather provide a dramatic friendly edit that gets them an answer than allow them to experience the rapid downvote/closure cycle that keeps them out of an answer.  (@justcal points out &quot;History closed 38.49% of all questions asked. We are the 13th highest closing rate (out of 176?), putting us in the top 7% for closing questions. 2 out 5 attempts to ask a question here are closed.&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are some patterns in flawed questions from new users.  Just as an example, it is very common to ask, &quot;What is a book on X?&quot;  Which we'll close immediately.  But if the question is &quot;Why does X happen?&quot;  our culture says that the answer should include citations/references that explain.  So a quick edit can transform a flawed question into question that will probably satisfy the new user, and perhaps keep them coming back.</p>

<li><p>I believe that the moderator should be an exception handler; I'd be happier if the community were to take on this task.  Problem is that 1) the way that SE is set up, the community can't do the pre-emptive closure, so the community winds up splitting effort among the various tasks; the lack of coordination leads to mutual frustration.</p>

<li><p>I have opinions about quality, but I'm not sure that my opinions are universal or approved. I wish there were a way to make this more democratic/distributed.  Or to provide a stronger opportunity for the community to tell moderators, &quot;No, that's not quite where we want to go&quot;</p>

Unfortunately, new users are often either unable or unwilling to take on board the community's comments and make the necessary improvements.</p>
<p>Mods are elected by the community so that gives you guys some authority and shows our trust in you. Thus, I think a strong case can be made in favour of your proposal to help a new user who is <strong>unable</strong> to edit his/her question. The problem is, how do you distinguish the <strong>unable</strong> from the <strong>unwilling</strong>? If you mod close quickly, there are unlikely to be any comments to help you judge whether or not the new user is amenable to an edit.</p>
<p>My impression is that new users who fall into the <strong>unwilling</strong> category do so mostly because they want to ask a question which simply doesn't fit with our guidelines. I don't think mods can do anything about those so the community should decide their fate (i.e. they'll get closed).</p>
<p>The only way I can see around the <em>'is the new user <strong>unable</strong> or <strong>unwilling</strong>?'</em> quandary is for the mod to make the edit and leave a (highlighted?) comment for the OP explaining why the edit was made, that it was done in good faith, but that they can roll-back if they don't like it. The community can still close the question if it so wishes, regardless of whether or not the mod's edit was accepted by the OP.</p>
<p><strong>In summary, if you think your proposal can rescue even a small percentage of questions from being closed, then go for it.</strong> Both the community and the OP will still be able to have their say. If, in time, the community or the mods themselves feel that this proposal isn't having the desired beneficial effects, it can be dropped (or someone may come up with a modification or better idea).</p>

<p>Lately I've tried to ask 1 question, and I've never seen a fastest closing. So, to address the situation, I decided to open a new question, this time I thought more objective, and again a very fast closing.</p>
<p>The 2nd question is <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/62839/on-the-comparison-of-the-1st-european-industrial-revolution-and-soviet-industria"">this one</a> and in the comments the 1st one is also linked.</p>
<p>I find it odd that the community had difficulties in trying to flesh out a decent answer from my admittedly first bad question... (some comments were interesting though), but had no qualms answering <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/39443/what-was-the-death-toll-during-the-inquisition"">this type of question</a>. This question was so broad, and yet it got more than one good answer. Has the culture/policy of this community somewhat changed since then? (Side note: Is it related to the Monica incident and potential flight of good moderators?)</p>
<p>My first question was accused of being too broad, and lacking an objective criteria to assess the best answer, and yet it still got 2 upvotes.
However, if I compare it the 2nd version of my question, where I purposefully tried to be as objective as I could possibly be, despite 1 obvious detail (constraining the geographical region), I considered the question a reasonable one. However, I was soon disabused of that notion. It got at least 3 downvotes in a matter of hours... Well, so what do you want? A more objective question, or a more broad question? Here's another <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/62821/how-long-was-a-sea-journey-from-england-to-east-africa-1868-1877"">example of a question</a> I would think it was not so focused, but still a reasonable one, in my opinion, and they tried to close it, and yet it still got at least 10 upvotes and a good answer.</p>
<p>Not even in mathematics have I seen this type of limitations... It stretches on the paradoxical and potentially inconsistent behaviour.</p>
<p>Well, I'm now ready to have this question closed, and to be suspended from History exchange.</p>

<ol>
<li>Its unusually hard to keep a question open here. Of the 20 questions posted in the last 3 days, 9 of them are currently on hold or closed. That's 45%; almost half.</li>
</ol>
<p>For Politics, the number for that same period as of right now is 38%. For Skeptics 25%. For the last 50 posts of Interpersonal, it looks like 20%. Movies&amp;TV 18%, SciFi 15%. Writing is 42%.</p>
<p>Of course of those surveyed sites, the ones most like this one in problem domain tend to be the ones with the highest closure rate. That's probably no coincidence.</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>The sites you're used to are unusually permissive (or get unusually good questions).</li>
</ol>
<p>Econ appears to be very high-traffic, and has only about 17% of its posts in the last 4 days sitting held or closed. Math is very low traffic, but I had to go back more than 50 posts (to January 13th) to find a second one that is closed. Both were closed for being dups. Not sure what's going on there.</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>You're not really doing that badly. From what I can see, half of your questions have been closed. That's the site average! Not bad really, for a newish user.</li>
<li>2 isn't a great sample size to be talking about trends with. So let's look at them individually.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/62839/what-are-the-death-tolls-for-the-1st-european-industrial-revolution-and-for-sovi"">The first</a> doesn't seem to be asking about a specific thing that someone can craft an interesting coherent answer around, but rather requesting people go off and do a ton of research for some quasi-related stats (the boring annoying part), perhaps so that you can compile and analyze them and make sense from them (the part we <em>like</em> to do).</p>
<p>Its not really a question about anything specific, just a request for people to go do a lot of work and report back with the results. What it needs is a site with volunteer <em>researchers</em>, where we are more a site of volunteer <em>analysts</em>.</p>
<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/62818/in-which-way-are-the-industrial-revolution-and-the-famine-during-the-first-years"">The second one</a>, well I'm going to say up front here that I disagree with its closure. In fact, the comment I put on it was intended to help someone else (who had the time to do it) to research and make a proper answer out of it.</p>
<p>So anyway, this is just going to be a SWAG, but I know we've had a bad experience with questions along this lines of &quot;This nutjob in a bar told me ...&quot; and this likely seemed close enough to that to get a lot of folk's closure fingers itchy.</p>
<p>There are currently 8 billion people in the world, and probably half of them have some unique ideas about history that are egregiously wrong. We don't have the time or the heart to try to address them all, so we need to stick to ones that are somewhere in the ballpark of reasonable. Personally I think we here could at least attack some of the more common popular misconceptions (sort of like Skeptics does routinely, but limited to History), but in practice those questions usually get closed.</p>
<p>Now, since its easy enough to do, should be enlightening, and because I don't want you to feel personally picked on, I'm going to go through the other 2 questions you posted and talk about what they did <strong>right</strong>.</p>
<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/47989/was-ezra-pound-a-descendent-of-jews"">This one</a> is wonderful in that its objectively answerable, and the person in question is famous enough that there are public resources available to research it without having to dig into genealogical tools. An answerer could even drop any related biographical info about the person in question that they happen to find interesting into their answer. Fun. It also managed to avoid the ham-handed hints of antisemitism that such a question might contain, and that plagues this site almost daily.</p>
<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/43815/how-many-people-were-killed-by-protestant-inquisition-style-tribunals-asking-fo"">This one</a> succeeded where the first one above failed because its only asking for a single number. It also implies that related info may suffice for an answer if the exact number in the exact format requested isn't easily available.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Lack of preliminary research: Please, make an effort to show what did you find out on your own, what do you know, what you could not determine, etc.  (As Al Capone used to say &quot;If you want to do something right, do it yourself!&quot;) This will also help with the lack of clarity. (Partial answers help to clarify what the actual question is.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lack of clarity: I read your questions few times and even after Mark's edit am not sure what are you really after. On the face of it, the immediate cause of famine in the Soviet Union in the early 1930s (let's focus on that one, taking place primarily in Ukraine and Turkestan) was not industrialization, but collectivization and the following confiscatory policies of the state.  (Imagine that somebody is driving to a supermarket, rans through a red light and kills a pedestrian. Do you think the pedestrian died because somebody's  kids back home needed food?) But at least, this question is rather narrow in space and time, so basically answerable, after a suitable reinterpretation. (Forget the industrialization, let's focus on the governmental policies.) In contrast, your question about the 19th century Industrial Revolution is:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(a) unfocused (even if you restrict Europe) since the Industrial Revolution in different European countries proceeded rather differently,</p>
<p>(b) covers a 100 year period, and things changed quite a bit in any given country during this period (hygiene, bacterial theory of diseases...),</p>
<p>(c) addresses a phenomenon driven primarily by market forces (and leading to depopulation of the countryside, move to cities, emergence of mass production...), rather than governmental decisions.</p>
<p>Because the causes are so indirect, this question (in my estimation) becomes pretty much unanswerable:</p>
<p>If a 35 year old male in USSR in 1930s dies from starvation, the cause is easy to see (even his neighbors could tell).</p>
<p>If a  35 year old male in England  in 1830s dies from, say, high fever and multiple organ failure, how would anybody know that the case was poor hygiene in his cramped housing which, in turn was caused by mass migration to cities, which, in turn, was caused by some economic changes? Or maybe it was not  poor hygiene, but poor chap had too much gin, contracted pneumonia and died from it a week later? Or maybe he was overworked and compensated by gin? Who would be able to tell? Not his doctor (he never saw one, and doctors at the time had no idea about causes of diseases or proper treatment). Not his priest (if the man was lucky to get the last rites in time). Not his family. So, there would be no records, no statistics.</p>
<p>On the positive side, there are historic studies on relation between human health and urbanization. A google search immediately gave me the article &quot;Urbanization and mortality in Britain, c. 1800–50&quot; (Economic History Review, 2020). I did not read this particular paper and maybe it does not address your question, but maybe you should, and you then can determine if this is what you want to learn about. (Now, we are back to item 1.)</p>

<p>As such your questions appear at or beyond the pale for historical commentary. A doctoral student asking to commit to comparative mortality in development would be pushed towards A Sen and the anthropology department. Historians ask, “what are the real contents of large document sets and what do these support having had reasonably happened?”  They avoid asking “what does what happened mean?” At least while acting as historians.</p>

I'd suggest you compare the question to the two references found at <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3885/1401"">how to write a good question</a>.   I'll offer a couple of additional opinions/reactions to the question; it is up to you to determine if they are useful.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>There is no preliminary research. No evidence that you've attempted to solve the problem.  No evidence that you've considered alternative explanations (e.g. weather, climate, etc.)  No evidence that you've compared the actual frequency of toplessness among men and women.  No evidence that you've considered the contexts in which toplessness does occur. (e.g. Burning Man, protests, etc.) Lack of preliminary research  frequently results in question closure.  Questions without preliminary research communicate &quot;I want to discuss....&quot;, not &quot;I have a question that I'm trying to answer....&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Related but distinct - why don't North Americans go topless (why are you asking about only one gender?  As one of the commenters points out the ability to go topless can be quite distinct from the preference to go topless.  Addressing this question would help to convince me that this is a sincere desire to answer the question rather than an attempt to discuss/provoke/elicit response.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I'm not going to speak on behalf of a community I'm not qualified to represent, but I have a hypothesis. I haven't tested this, but I strongly suspect that a casual conversation with any female acquaintances will reveal that going topless in public is likely to result in unwelcome behavior. (I'm not saying that this is appropriate; I'm saying that there are men out there who will interpret topless women in a context that is, perhaps, not intended).   There are probable consequences for toplessness that I imagine are not entirely positive.  If I were interested in the question, I'd be interested in the relative importance of comfort, fashion and other factors in women's apparel choices. This question ignores all these factors, which suggests that the intent is to provoke, rather than to find an answer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Not everything that happened in the past is history; not everything that happens in history is significant. There is no attempt within the question to suggest that the question or the answer is important or significant in any way. This contributes to the impression that this isn't a sincere question.</p>

<p>Summary: let's treat this as an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">X:Y question</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem"">fix the question.</a></p>
<p>I think <em>most</em> of the time, we can answer the underlying question by helping the OP to revise the question to fit within our guidelines.  Everything below assumes that answers on H:SE <em>should</em> include citations (there are some exceptions, but even in those cases, answers with citations will generally rise above those that omit them).  I'm going to revise the problem statement and then offer some suggested solutions.  Building on @gtkscrk's analysis; When I see a question that requests references, I think the <em>actual</em> question falls into one of the following categories</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>I want to know X; I've checked the secondary sources and I need to verify with a primary</em> - I believe this is/should be permitted on our site. I've added the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/primary-source"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;primary-source&#39;"" rel=""tag"">primary-source</a> tag to allow people to very specifically request primary source answers.  This is a fairly rare pattern, but it happens.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Where can I read about X?</em>  <em>If</em> there is a canonical source, then this is a corollary to the previous case; we can provide it. This is permitted on our site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I want to learn about X; I don't know enough to know where to begin to look_?  I'm sympathetic to these questions, and sympathetic to those who point out that answering these questions encourages the type of inquiry that resulted in all of us being here. But there are several fundamental problems.  First and foremost, questions of this type <em>should</em> be closed as vague and unfocused.  Second, it is impossible to provide an authoritative answer; all answers are equally valid and equally useless. Third, these are the kind of questions that are more likely to produce arguments/discussion than answers (for precisely the reasons identified in the second problem). These  questions are likely to produce opinionated answers.  Whigs will offer suggestions that are diametrically at odds with Labor historians, and then the other disciplines will join in with their analytical frameworks and it is only a matter of time before bricks are thrown.</p>
<p>a. In this case, I would suggest that we close the question, refer the individual to Wikipedia, and ask them to come back with a specific question.  (Optionally point out that Wikipedia has references, that are probably as good as you'll get from H:SE)  If the question is &quot;Where can I learn about the Riders of Rohan?&quot;, close the question, refer them to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohan_(Middle-earth)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rohan</a>, and ask them to come back with a specific question, e.g. &quot;Were the horses of the eored gaited?&quot;.  H:SE is far better suited to answer the specific question than the general (yes, I know that any questions about Rohan are out of scope but I wanted an example that was less likely to distract people with real history) This is a change from our site procedures; I'm open to feedback.</p>
<p>b. Sometimes the response is &quot;I've checked Wikipedia and I don't understand X. . . &quot; - to which the correct reply is (a) fantastic, (b)  Then let's revise your question to focus on &quot;I don't understand X&quot; - that is what you want to know right now - that is the narrow question that H:SE exists to answer and (c) please always include that preliminary research in the question.</p>
<p>c. Alternatively ask in comments, &quot;Yeah, X is fascinating, but it is a broad topic; what interests you about X?&quot;, or invite the OP to chat where you can offer all the suggestions that you want.</p>
<p>d. I've seen people offer &quot;standard&quot; (not quite canonical, but the acknowledged first reference on X) references in comments, and I think that's fine.<br />
e. I'd be happy to try the chatroom again</p>
</li>
<li><p>I want to understand X, but my current research is leading me in circles (example 'Why did East Germany fail? And why did DDR need hard currency 1986-1989?') The example didn't explicitly ask for references, but this is another case where I think we need to be as welcoming as possible; OP is <em>doing</em> the research, but for some reason (frame challenge, obscure technical definitions, arcane assumptions), OP can't move forward. This is the kind of thing that H:SE does <em>extremely well</em>  We need to look past the reference request and revise the question to focus on what OP really needs to know (in this case they <em>don't know</em> what they need to know, because of the frame problem).  (this is a minor variation of other cases, but is worth discussing separately).</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>I want to learn about X</em> (e.g. &quot;Are there primary sources about Jinnah's vision for Pakistan?&quot;) - examining the question, this isn't a request for primary sources - this is a request for information about Jinnah's vision for Pakistan.</p>
<p>a. Quickly revise the question to focus on the knowledge sought.  &quot;What was Jinnah's vision for Pakistan?&quot;  The request for a source is a red herring; while I'm reluctant to ascribe motivations, my hypothesis is that these are questions from new people who don't know that they don't need to ask for a source; the source will be provided.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thoughts? Feedback?  Can anyone extend the list of tactics to provide answers to the <em>actual</em> question while retaining our focus on providing authoritative answers?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_(name)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Immanuel</a> is a name originating in the biblical Hebrew name עִמָּנוּאֵל‎, meaning &quot;God with us&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No amount of &quot;any reasonable user…&quot; can rectify this. Taking the perspective of 'the claimed-to-be-offended calls the shots' is an unreasonable approach. Arguing pro-bono and preemptively in that direction makes it worse. All atheists may take offense at any username praising any deity. So are they all off the board? Even if that's what is to be read in the real-world passports?</p>
<p>Just today I read a whole string of very pro-Catholic apologetic answer pieces from a username with such a 'billboard'-/-theophoric name, Hebrew origin, Italian spelling (to avoid directly calling out any obvious user for this it is roughly &quot;God will raise&quot;).<br />
It is indistinguishable whether it's a real name, only a made up one, but in any case it's meaning is unquestionably of the billboard type.</p>
<p>We need to define this in a logically deductible manner:</p>
<ol>
<li>State the reason for the rules. There are more cases to be considered, with specifics of varying qualities.</li>
<li>State the manner in which this is judged, with precision (which is totally absent now, things like &quot;any true scotsman finds that offensive&quot; or &quot;blatant&quot; are very much in the eye of the beholder)</li>
<li>State the steps of consequences that should follow from this (are users contacted first, with chance to explain or self-action; are they notified of a reset; is there room for appeal)</li>
</ol>
<p>There are other examples for perhaps problematic usernames.</p>
<p>The above does <em>not necessarily</em> say that all usernames must be allowed. (Although I would be in favour of allowing almost any such names, not only those like Amadeus, Bogdan, Christian, etc)</p>
<p>This answer says we need better though-out &amp; better written rules, more 'positive law', to guide the course of actions to be taken.</p>

(1) What follows is my personal opinion, submitted for feedback. &lt;PITD: Please Ignore The Diamond&gt;<br />
(2) @LangLangC feels (if I interpret the above correctly) that we need to clarify the policy on acceptable usernames.</p>
<p>First and foremost, &quot;bad case makes for worse law&quot; - Positive law tends to the lowest common denominator.  Although SE written policy is relatively neutral, SE behavior has made it very clear that the presumption is on the side of offense; it is far more important that we avoid offense than that we tolerate diversity/expression/etc.  Moderators have signed an agreement that basically states that we can be held accountable for inaction in the case of offense; there was no mention in that agreement, or in any other SE policy that says that we will be held to account for suppressing things down.  At the moment, I'm assuming that commentary in this thread that my username is offensive is rhetorical hyperbole; if someone is truly offended by my username, please make that clear and I will change my username.</p>
<p>The request is for positive law - but I think positive law is most appropriate in regime's with a deliberative body dedicated to, and accountable for, making positive law.  SE is more akin to a common law framework where action is taken based on precedent and referenda.</p>
<p>Second, I think the answer above is relatively clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>user names are special, as they are plastered over every post the user makes, and other users are forced to type those words to interact with your posts. For that reason, if anyone plausibly finds a username offensive, it should probably be flagged and reset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The current discussion arises because we changed a username that articulated a religious opinion; responding to that user or referencing that user required me to type out that religious creed.  I happen to have a great deal of respect for that creed, and that is why I am uncomfortable using it in this context. For the adherents of that creed, that it sacred; for me it is not, and <em>I personally</em> feel that it is not appropriate for me to usurp semiotics that others find sacred. It makes me uncomfortable precisely because I feel that doing so is disrespectful.  I also believe that another person of faith might reasonably construe my use to be less than respectful; I'm not fully cognizant of the requirements for respectfully using the semiotics &amp; symbols of that faith. Some members of our community may legitimately adhere to faiths which would make it difficult or impossible to refer to a username which incorporates a statement of faith without violating the precepts of their faith.</p>
<p>Right now usernames are assumed to be in good faith, and exceptions are handled by the moderators on a case by case basis. I defer to community decision on this, but in my personal opinion, that is the correct approach.  The alternative is to assert that the username is an identifier and should not be used for expressive purposes. Erosion of the margins is likely to reduce all usernames to meaningless strings.

When I am acting as a moderator, the following are (some of ) the factors that I will consider as I contemplate whether a given username is appropriate for the community:  (these are capabilities, not standards; factors for consideration, not thresholds)</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Is the primary purpose of this username to identify the user, or to articulate some viewpoint? is this a name or a billboard?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is there precedent that this username (or one like it) has been found offensive?</p>

<li><p>Is the username <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_facie"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">prima facie</a> a violation of the <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/conduct"">Code of Conduct</a>?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Does this username plausibly evoke terms/words/concepts that have previously been determined to be inappropriate for this community. Let's call this the &quot;fellow traveller/dogwhistle&quot; rule; this is rare, but there are communities of trolls who tenaciously try to find marginal cases where they can articulate their viewpoints while remaining within the rules.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Does this username reference an intrinsic characteristic? (race/religion/gender/nationality/etc. - not things we choose, but things that are intrinsic to us) Are there contexts in using the username with the intrinsic characteristic might plausibly be presumed to be disrespectful to the community referred to by that characteristic?  Are there contexts in which it will not be clear whether the username refers to the individual or the community?  Note: This is very difficult to express clearly. This is the best I can do to summarize the years I've spent thinking about diversity and inclusivity. I'm very well aware that it is incomplete, but the topic of how to respect diversity can quickly rise to book length.  please accept the above as a litote rather than as positive law).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Does this username reference a political opinion which might be damaging to the community?  Is this username likely to give rise to debate/discussion/rancor/argument that is not germane to the community? (this one is <em>really subjective</em>; I tend to be very tolerant and apply <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobellis_v._Ohio"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stewart's razor</a>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is this username a common identifier? Would I expect to find this in a phone book? (although this may sound trivial, there are a couple of usernames that are uncommon for me personally, but I'm aware that within their communities, they are quite common.  This is here to ensure that I remain inclusive, and to avoid assuming that the entire community must be bounded by my personal experience).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I reserve the right to extend that list as situations merit. I'm not going to articulate thresholds for the above; they are what computer scientists call capabilities, not requirements.  While there are cases of clear offense where I'd be comfortable acting immediately, in the normal course of affairs, the process of reaching a discussion involves dialogue with the relevant user, closed debate and discussion with other moderators. , but</p>

It seems like this might be something along the lines of what video gamers call an 'exploit'. If a user gets a bunch of downvotes, or perhaps suspensions for plagiarism or voting irregularities, destroys their own account or has it destroyed by the system , then they can start over with a 'clean slate'? Since it seems punishment's (suspensions) are dealt on a scale according to the number of offenses, then the old offenses aren't held against them anymore?</p>
<p>I have noticed our troll reappears with new account name on a periodic basis, sometimes even registering instead of just trolling as an unregistered user, and these accounts are subsequently destroyed.</p>
<p>I know we users aren't privy to some of the moderator level information, and destroyed accounts never reveal (to my understanding) the reason why the account was destroyed (user initiated or 'Community/moderator initiated).</p>
<p>Sorry if I am rambling, but I guess the main query is two-fold:</p>
<p>Is there some policy concerning a former user restarting with a new  account?</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Is there a situational difference in this policy dependent on if the account was system destroyed for violations or if the destruction was at the users request (say someone was upset over oppressive new policies and wanted to not participate any more and have their user name removed in protest...)</p>
<p>To be clear, I am not asking about two users with the same username, but a user who reappears after an old account (which may have had violations against it) is destroyed and assumes a 'new identity'.</p>
<p>I looked into some 'higher level' meta  discussions of the subject, and these showed up:</p>
<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/204783/376554"">Users should not be able to wipe their record by requesting account deletion and then recreating the account [duplicate]</a></p>

<p>Ironically enough, @T.E.D.s' response</p>
<blockquote>

happened enough for there to need to be one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>may have been a case of foreshadowing.</p>
<p>It appears to me that <em><strong>another</strong></em> ex-user whose account had been suspended and then eventually deleted seems to have reappeared. This one, (<a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/41034/16951"">user26763</a> after account deletion) was suspended for low quality contributions, and the returned account does not appear to show any improvement; still refusing to properly cite or provide sources and updating information in comments instead of using site provided features and editing the answer.<br />
(Another re-visitation to a question the user previously answered <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/40447/16951"">here</a>)</p>
<p>One occurrence, just a novelty, an inconvenience. But now two in as many months; perhaps a policy may be needed?</p>

<p>In fact, I think its quite possible for two accounts to have the same name.</p>
<p>I think there was once an issue elsewhere on the site about someone using that to impersonate a famous user (Jeff Atwood, IIRC), but I don't remember that being a problem here.</p>
<p>I have seen at least one instance on another site where a former mod who ragequit during the Monica drama later came back with a new account using the same name after they cooled off (and are currently running in that site's moderator election). Its a little confusing, but strikes me as something that should be allowed.</p>
<hr />
<p>That being said, if its the Troll I'm thinking of, you may be misunderstanding what's happening. We just had this same discussion about this same person in the private moderator chat.</p>
<p>There is one particular troll who has made themselves such a network-wide pest that they've earned a unique level of attention from SE network mods.</p>
<p>This site was one of the troll's (shockingly many) favorite victims. Enough so that they were likely one of the main reasons we went to 4 mods rather than 3. Sempaiscuba was particularly good at ferreting out which new accounts were the troll's new socks, and we'd generally as mods destroy those accounts (cue sound effect of woodchipper).</p>
<p>Recently (like the past year or so), I've been noticing their original account reappearing on content (some of it new, some old). What appears to be going on here is that SE mods are now <strong>also</strong> on the hunt for this troll's socks. When they find one, instead of firing up the wood chipper like we'd do here, they instead merge the sock account with the troll's main account. The effect of this is that the offending sock account automatically suspended until after the North West administration, and that posts it made now show up with the main account name instead of the sock's name.</p>
<p>I can see why they'd prefer to do that. Its possible (although highly unlikely) that the sock actually posted some good content somewhere on the network that an individual site wanted to keep. Just throwing the sock in the chipper like we do also deletes all its posts and comments.</p>
<p>My suggestion going forward is if you see an old undeleted post from this individual appear, vote to delete it and/or flag it for deletion.</p>

Also, I think that the answer has to be that if they were not useful they would not have been built in such profusion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>as pointed out in the comments, I asked several questions, not just one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My aim is to understand how castles were planned and built, down to the last detail (books &amp; URLS are very welcome).</p>
<p>To that end, I would like to propose a series of questions, and my question here is whether this would be acceptable.</p>
<p>Here are some topics, from the top of my head. I imagine that more may be added later and that answers may lead to further questions.</p>
<p>I have a vision of an epic question chain, lasting for months, maybe longer, with one focused question per week, building on previous answers, until we understand out castle in the minutest detail.</p>
<p>Feel free to add more questions, re-order them or just plain say this series of questions is off-topic or uninteresting.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>how many will attack me? Probably based on medieval history. How large would armies have been? How many of them can attack me at once? There is not much having 300,000 warriors if there are only enough walls for only 1,000 to attack simultaneously. However, they will also need archers, siege canon, such as trebuchet, etc. Perhaps they work in shifts, relived as men get tired? Cavalry to quell the local populace and cut off supply lines? Medics, cooks, drovers, etc, etc? We probably don't need to consider the non-combatants (other than that they need supplies, and perhaps insomuch as anyone can swing a sword when attacked)</p>
</li>
<li><p>for how long must I withstand siege, if it comes to that, until an army is raised and help arrives? (since there are no standing armies). How long does it take to raise, arm &amp; equip, train(?) enough to defeat the number of attackers from the first question? Hmm, how long can they besiege me, given an &quot;average&quot; supply chain (whatever that is)?</p>
</li>
<li><p>the purpose of my castle? I will state that, although comments might be welcome. It is a sally point for a garrison. If any army passes with X miles on either side, we can sally forth and assail them. It also forces any passing army to stop sand engage, since they will not want to leave a garrisoned castle at their rear. When they stop, either the castle can attack, or an allied army can attack the besiegers from the rear.</p>
</li>
<li><p>who else is in my castle, other than the garrison? I suspect that there will be a fixed number of some positions, such as the actual castle lord, and a variable number, based on the garrison size, of others, e.g cooks, medics, smiths, armorers, fletchers .... and probably more professions. How many people in total in the castle? (and, do I want to allot space for peasants from the surrounding countryside?)</p>
</li>
<li><p>what supplies do I need for all of these? Water, food (livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, chickens), grain, preserved foodstuffs? Water and fodder for the livestock? Do I slaughter &amp; salt the livestock, except for necessary horses at the start of the siege?</p>
</li>
<li><p>which buildings are necessary for all of the above? I seek an exhaustive list, right down to the toilets, with sizes, and hopefully we can draw a floorplan. This gives us a feel for the necessary size of the castle. Let's start with HQ, armoury, medical bay, chapel(?), smithy, tanner(?), storage for food, water, animals, sleeping quarters, timber, leather, .... ?</p>
</li>
<li><p>where to site the castle? If we have free range, do we build on top of a hill? That's good to tire attackers, makes it difficult/impossible to bring up siege engines (towers, trebuchet, etc). If there is a rock base, they won't be able to tunnel and undermine the walls. But, a hill means very deep wells, possibly dug through rock, to have access to water. Unless we build near a river, but what are the pros/cons of that? Genghis Khan <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/58dgdi/do_we_have_any_primary_sources_that_say_that/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">diverted a river</a> to flood a city; could a similar approach undermine our walls?</p>
</li>
<li><p>given the approximate known size of the populace and buildings, we have the size of the inner walls. Do we only have one set, or is there a fallback a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_(castle)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bailey </a>? Or two, so that each can defend the other? How many ad why?</p>
</li>
<li><p>how height should the walls be, and how thick? If we accommodate some form of catapult, that might determine the thickness, as would the damage doable by attacking artillery ( I am going to say that there is no gunpowder). We may also want a certain number of rows of defenders on the walls, plus stores of ammunition, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How many staircases lead up to the walls? Enclosed or open? How far apart? Do they need to built near to certain buildings, or vice versa?</p>
<p>If  am not building on rock, how deep do the walls go beneath ground in order to prevent or hinder tunneling?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>how may towers do I need in order to enfilade the attackers? How far apart are they? How tall? How many defending archers or other troops can be active at once (those little slit windows won't allow many archers per floor to fire at once)). Should they be as tall as the walls, or butt out at the top (with holes in the bottom)?</p>
</li>
<li><p>one entrance only? Easier to defend, but limits sally possibilities. The more entrances, the more flexibility, but the more attack points. How to construct the gates? Iron reinforced wood? Portcullis? One gate, or two, with murder holes between.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If on flat ground, do we need a moat? How wide, deep? Ditch or water filled? Stakes/caltrops at the bottom?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Errrm, that's probably enough to give a feel for it. I could write more, but may just bore you. I think that there is enough here to decide whether this could be a meaningful series of questions or not.</p>

<p>This obviously cannot be a single question. It requires a series of questions, each building upon the answers of those previous.</p>
<p>So, (finally), my question to you is whether a series of detailed questions would be on-topic (probably) and welcome (this is where I am unsure).</p>
<hr />
<p>[Update : moved here from my reply to @Mark's comment question]</p>
<p>I am purely interested in real world castles. I am currently living in the UK and am totally fascinated. I am happy to restrict it to a century or two in the UK. Also, any mention of gunpowder was only to say that I don't want my castle to have to defend against it.</p>
<p>I am a programmer by trade trade. We start with requirements : &quot;withstand an army of X for a period of Y&quot;; we go back &amp; forth, asking questions of the intended end-user until we are certain that the requirements are complete and consistent. Then we proceed to the software architecture and review that until it fullis the requirements and is consistent.</p>
<p>Then, we start on the detailed design, which also requires a lot of review. in fact, the actual coding part of it takes only 10% or 15% of the total time. But, I digress. I can look at castles, as they exist now. I can infer - but I do not know, and I wish to know.</p>
<p>From the largest &quot;how large a garrison do I need to withstand a force of X?&quot; right down to &quot;I notice that the fletchers are always built near to the privvies. I wonder why (invented example)&quot;.</p>
<p>I  want to understand exactly how a castle was planned (the mechanics of the building interest me, personally, less). I want to get inside the minds of those who planned castles. There is no one book that I can find which does so. I am willing to spend 5 or 10 years researching and write it myself (to very little audience, no doubt), and here seems like a good start, before I dig into the tomes.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Do (and show us) your research.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Quick questions, or one-two line questions which show no evidence of previous research have a high likelihood of being downvoted and closed.  To generate proper, sourced answers often takes a good amount of time, and it is quite irritating to write up an answer and the OP says 'Ya, I read that, but wanted something else...'. Well sourced questions do better here.</p>
<p>Not only outside sources, but look at this site. There are 361 mentions of 'castle' in a site search. We may have covered the issue before. Look at those answers, and follow up on the sources they cite.</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><strong>Eliminate <em>any hypothetical aspect</em> from your question.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We close hypotheticals, often rather quickly.  Sometimes a hypothetical can be hidden as a search for historical facts. Not 'How many men might besiege my hypothetical castle', but 'What was the largest army to besiege a castle (in your time and place)' or 'How many men were in King Henry's Army during battle so and so'.  Remember if you ask these without first checking that they can be readily answered (back to do your research) on Wikipedia or in earlier questions, the questions will be closed...</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li><strong>Be specific enough, (but not too specific)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We get a lot of questions which want 'medieval' information for worldbuilding/historical fiction use.  Medieval covers a 1000 year span, and can be applied across a large range of cultures.  Be specific concerning time period and location, enough for authoritative research to answer your question within reason. As pointed out in comments, information relevant to England might not be relevant another location. (looking for information on the military use of castles will limit your time frame anyway)</p>
<p>On the other hand, try not to be so specific as to eliminate the presentation of possibly related solutions to your question. If you were asking about the first development of courtyard castles and specify only in England, you might miss out on an answer which can compare the development in France.</p>
<ol start=""4"">
<li><strong>Be ready for downvotes and closures, and be interactive when it happens.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We close 4 out of 10 questions here. When your question is closed, don't immediately abandon it, but look at the comments and try to address the issues raised, and make substantial edits to correct the perceived issues with the question. OPs that do this have a much better chance of reopening a question.</p>
<p>Be cautious about being <em>too</em> interactive. Make responses to comments by altering the question when applicable.</p>
<ol start=""5"">
<li><strong>Don't swarm the site, and be patient.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You talk about wanting to ask a large string of questions, but it has been my experience that swarms of questions are often look at as intrusive, especially if the questions need to build on each other or are closely related enough that they might somehow be considered duplicate. Sometimes its best to get an answer before proceeding to the next question. (This appears to be the format you were considering anyways.)</p>
<p>It takes time to do this type of research, and build a decent answer. The worldbuilder people respond, sometimes rapidly, with unsupported information. That is discouraged here. Sometime users here want to reply with poorly sourced information (Wikipedia, Blogs, random websites='the internet says'). This also is discouraged here. It may take several days before a good answer shows up.</p>
<p>On the other hand, again, if the question can be instantly answered by a link to Wikipedia, then see pt. 1; the question was not a good question by site standards.
Do your research first.</p>
<hr />
<p>All that said, I hope after you research your topics that some of them find their way onto the site as questions.</p>
<p>...And since this is meta, and reference requests weren't really the topic here, I'll offer one. There was a six part series on Discovery/Channel 4 with historian <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Morris"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Marc Morris</a> called Castle.

<p>History is a science, and like most sciences advances through conflict (through the dialectic).</p>
<ol>
<li>Sometimes there is a consensus  (George Washington lived).</li>
<li>Sometimes there is not a consensus. (From a historical perspective, Krishna may or may not have been an appropriated historical figure.)</li>
<li>Sometimes we just don't know.  (we had an excellent example of this recently, but I can't find it.</li>
<li>Sometimes there is no authoritative answer to the question.  I'd argue that the long running debate on the legality of Southern Secession is in this category, but there are other examples.  The answer depends on interpretations and judgments. Depends on the specific definitions you give to terms.  While arguments can be made for both sides, there is no test that would allow you to confirm or deny either hypothesis.  These kind of questions are a slippery slope towards <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilpul"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pilpuls</a> and are dangerous for H:SE because they invite debate and rancor.  These slide</li>
<li>Frequently the answer depends on how you define the terms; if the question is based on imprecise terms, then multiple answers are possible.</li>
<li>Sometimes the answer is context dependent (e.g. &quot;What is the definition of “indigenous” for historical purposes?&quot; et. al.)  There is no universal definition; there is a definition that works in this context for this article or this study.</li>
</ol>
<p>And sometimes these questions are actually a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkQhK8O9Jik&amp;ab_channel=MontyPython"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">request for an argument</a>; these merit a downvote.</p>
<h2>How to fix?</h2>
<p>If your question possibly fits this anti-pattern, then I would suggest that you</p>
<ol>
<li>Document your preliminary research</li>
<li>Clearly define all terms</li>
<li>Specify how you will select an authoritative answer.  Will you accept an answer of &quot;We don't know&quot;, if that answer is supported by strong evidence/reasoning?</li>

<p>This <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">anti-pattern</a> describes questions that rely on imprecisely defined terms; multiple contradictory answers are possible depending on how you define those terms.  As a consequence it is not possible to provide an authoritative answer to the question.</p>

Economic historians might date &quot;civilization&quot; at the invention of money; Marxists will define it differently.</p>
<h2>Fix</h2>
<p>If a question is tagged with this anti-pattern, the comment should also identify the term or terms requiring definition.  OP should edit the question to clarify how the term is defined within the context of the question - what definition will be used to select an authoritative answer?</p>
<p>The question will be strengthened if the definition is linked to a reference or external source - a definition that has been subjected to scholarly scrutiny to identify and resolve problems with the definition.</p>

<p>H.SE is a Q&amp;A site. We are based on the assumption that questions have authoritative answers.   While &quot;good question&quot; is a spectrum, the best<sup>1</sup> questions are those where any arbitrary participant can independently look at the answers and tell which of the answers best responds to the question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been stated again and again that Stack Exchange is not designed to handle questions with many answers. It doesn't need to be stated at all; it should be obvious from the design. The sorting, the pagination, the Accepted Answer concept; real questions have answers, not items or ideas or opinions. <em><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/75168/should-polls-be-maintained-as-community-wiki-questions-or-should-they-be-closed/75179#75179"">meta.stackexchange.com</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We assume that questions have authoritative answers.  &quot;Authoritative&quot; means both that the answer relies on authority, <em>and</em> that multiple people comparing the answers given will probably select the same answer as &quot;best&quot;.</p>
<ol>
<li>Subjective answers aren't authoritative.  &quot;What do you think of X&quot; or even &quot;Discuss X in the context of Y...&quot; cannot have authoritative answers.</li>
<li>Argumentative answers are <em>usually</em> not authoritative. If you ask &quot;What caused the Great Depression?&quot;, you'll get one answer from a monetarist, and a second answer from a Keynesian, and a third answer from a Marxist.  There will probably be a third answer from someone still waving the banner of the Austrian school.  And if you're lucky you'll get another answer from someone examining the same question through the distinction of the Washington consensus vs the Beijing consensus.  Each of them will present research and evidence and clear theories. But they won't agree. There is no way to select an authoritative answer.</li>
<li>Homework questions have authoritative answers, but <em>only the teacher who assigned</em> knows what the answer is.  Homework questions aren't designed to test your knowledge of the subject, but your ability to regurgitate what the teacher has curated in their lesson plans.  These will probably be closed pre-emptively.</li>
<li>List questions are not authoritative (in the general case).  If you ask &quot;Who signed the Declaration of Independence, there is a canonical list and the answer has to match that list.  But if you ask &quot;Give me some examples of left handed red headed historical figures&quot;, there is, by definition, no way to achieve an authoritative answer.  If the first answer gives you examples &quot;A,B&quot; and the second answer gives &quot;C, D&quot;, which of those answers is better?  What if the third answer is &quot;B,D&quot;?  which is the authoritative answer?  (and there is never an end to the answers, which is another problem.)</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to fix</h2>
<p>Difficult to provide general guidance, but there are a couple of common patterns</p>
<h3>Can X be considered Y?</h3>
<p>(e.g. &quot;Can Commodus be considered King of the Britons?&quot;)  This is intrinsically subjective; if the first answer says &quot;yes&quot; with evidence and the second answer says &quot;no&quot; with evidence, both are valid answers to the question.<br />
Revise the question into a hypothesis.  A better question would be, &quot;What evidence supports granting Commodus the title &quot;King of the Britons&quot;?&quot;   The question text can request that the answer address counterarguments (a good answer will address counterarguments); the authoritative answer is the best support for (or opposition to) that hypothesis.</p>
<h2>Question requests a secondary reference</h2>
<p>See <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/896/are-requests-for-references-appropriate-on-history-stack-exchangerevisited"">Are requests for references appropriate on History Stack Exchange?</a>.  But one of the core problems with reference requests is that (with the exception of canonical references), what <em>I</em> think is a good reference, may not be a good reference for you.</p>
<p>This is another example of an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">anti-pattern</a> that may not merit a downvote, but poses problems for history.stackexchange.com</p>
<h3>How to fix.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Don't ask list questions; revise the question to ask what you want to know. Why are you making a list?.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If you really want evidence to support a historical theory then revise the question to <strong>ask about that theory</strong></li>
<li>If you must ask about a list, then explain how you'll evaluate the answers and how you will identify the single best answer from all those provided.</li>
</ul>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><p>Don't ask for references; ask a question about the information you want to find.  All answers should include references, which will give you the information you want to find.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Re-read your question and double check that it is possible for someone (other than you) to identify the best, most authoritative answer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<ol>
<li><em>Aside: That doesn't mean that questions without an authoritative answer are <strong>bad</strong>; many of them are fascinating to discuss.  There are questions I discuss in the pub with my mates, and there are questions that I examine in a scholarly dissertation.  Neither question is &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot;.  Questions with authoritative answers are appropriate for H:SE; questions without authoritative answers should be elsewhere</em></li>

You may be able to think of other, completely different examples that are better than the example I have provided here.  If you think of a better example, then I encourage you to post your example here.</p>
<p>Historical records indicate that chess player Bobby Fischer &quot;defeated both Mark Taimanov and Bent Larsen with perfect 6-0 scores.&quot;  Now, let us suppose (purely a hypothetical, and I don't claim to have any evidence whatsoever to support this) that somebody paid Taimanov and Larsen to deliberately lose those games against Fischer.  Would that be of interest to historians?</p>
<p>Now, I can imagine that some people might say, &quot;No, that would not be of interest to historians.&quot;  After all, the actual moves that were made in those games have been recorded.  We know what happened.  Motives are in the mind of the individual, and not open to inspection.  Thus, motives are matters of opinion, not fact.</p>
<p>What I am wondering is ... continuing my example ... why it matters that Spassky lost to Fischer if (again purely as a hypothetical) he was ordered by the leaders of the USSR to lose to Fischer.  For example, we can imagine (again purely as a hypothetical) that the leaders of the USSR had a plan to use symbolic events such as chess games to evoke over-confidence among people in the USA.</p>
<p>Now, I can also understand the point of view that identifies motives as being an important part of history.  For example, if people stopped watching games played by the highest rated chess players in the world, and chose to instead watch games played by actors who don't know how to play chess and play only the moves that their script tells them to play on the chess board, then we would be witnessing a real shift.</p>
<p>Arguably, if motives are important, then the shift would be good for historians because, while actors are doing their jobs as actors, their real motive (to entertain an audience) is clear.  In contrast, Fischer defeating Larsen 6-0 or defeating Spassky is not as significant  as it initially would seem, if Larsen and Spassky were trying to lose, and were only pretending that they were trying to avoid losing.</p>
<p>Remember, all of the references to chess are merely for the purpose of illustration.  The question is more general.  You saw it in the title, and for your convenience I now repeat it below:</p>

<p>I can understand why a question like &quot;Could the Axis have gotten a negotiated peace in World War II?&quot; be considered opinion based. But at that wasn't the question.</p>

<p>I have <strong>huge</strong> respect for all the moderators on H.S.E, and greatly appreciate T.E.D's expertise, but as one of the (sadly) few female members, I feel I have a duty to challenge sexism when I see it. 'Manliness' - however defined - does not rely on facial hair or broad shoulders.</p>
<p>Ironically, on closer inspection, the subject <em>appears</em> to be wearing an engagement ring on the left ring finger - not, AFAIK, a very <strong>manly</strong> habit!</p>
<p>History is about truth, not our current prejudices or sensitivities. The subject of the photograph appeared to me to be a woman, thus probably making the back story <strong>more</strong> interesting, not less. To see this as a slur on some ideological idea of 'manliness' is, putting it politely, unhelpful.</p>

<li>Its not hard to think up scenarios where that kind of speculation would be quite unwelcome. Particularly since the subjects of photo ID questions tend to be the relatives of the posters.</li>

<p>Under those circumstances, <strong>two comments about it seemed plenty</strong>.

<p>That question got put on the HNQ list quite early in its life, if I remember correctly. That of course means there's a link to it on the right of the browser for <em>every</em> user in the StackExchange system. Even if the only reason they are here is because they <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/"">got stuck in VIM</a>. If the title in the question is particularly clickbaity from the perspective of a person who isn't already a History user it can drive a ton of new traffic into a question.</p>
<p>The plus is that the hordes of new eyeballs got it a motherloade of upvotes and answers (at least by our standards).</p>
<p>The downside is that all these new eyeballs aren't as acquainted with the standards of this site as our regular users, probably weren't brought here by any real interest in History, and a certain % of them are likely to just be flat out numbskulls.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we do have some tools to deal with this.</p>
<ol>
<li>Protect the question. This will prevent new users from posting answers. This measure is most effective if its getting a lot of bad answers from new users.</li>
<li>Move comments to chat. This is a good option for a post where users really want to get a bit chatty, but we'd kind of like to keep the comments attached to the post functional in nature.</li>
<li>Comment lock. This is a new feature (yay!) that allows us to prevent comments from being added to a post. For when users won't or can't be trusted to refrain from posting comments of marginal or worse utility.</li>
<li>(Most drastic) Remove the question from the HNQ. This will turn off the tap of numbskulls. It of course also turns off all the positive things that HNQ status was bringing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of the options above, I think any highly trusted site user can do 1, but the other steps require a diamond mod, so getting them done requires getting the attention of one of us and convincing us to do so. That can be done via flags, meta (here), or an appropriate chat like <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1560/the-time-machine"">The Time Machine</a> or <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/92831/hnq-history"">HNQ History</a>. I think as a general rule we should be very sympathetic to any such request from the question owner.</p>
<hr />
<p>As for this specific instance, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think your main issue is numbskulls in the comments? If so, we could perhaps lock the comments on the question. In fact, it appears that another moderator has already done that.</p>

<p>I believe that the actual question was ok. My understanding was that the votes to close were because the question was opinion based. My further belief is that was true of the &quot;real&quot; question I wanted to ask, but not the question I actually asked.</p>
<p>The &quot;real&quot; question was if the American army of 1944 had stood in place of the French army of 1940, would the allies have still been defeated by the Germans? That goes into hypotheticals, alternate history, etc., which is why I didn't ask it that way.</p>
<p>The question I actually asked started something like the following: In 1940, the French army of  2.2 million men, x tanks, and y planes was defeated by the Germans. In 1944, the Americans fielded 2.5 million men, x1 tanks and y1 planes (I don't know the values for x1 and y1, except I'm pretty sure that they were larger than x and y.) The question then was how did the American army of 1944 stack up to the French army of 1940. The implication was that unless the American army of 1944 was much stronger than the French army of 1940, the allies would have been defeated. Probably it would have taken a combination of American, British, and French armies (all at peak strength) to beat the Germans in 1940.</p>
<p>There were some excellent comments about the fact that the German army of 1944 was a shadow of its 1940 self because most of it had been lost in Russia, and another that (allied) tank doctrine had improved after France 1940. Those were fine answers to my &quot;real&quot; question.</p>
<p>But to limit its scope, is a question about the ways the numerically equivalent American army of 1944 differed (presumably in a positive way) from the defeated French army of 1940 appropriate for the site?</p>

At the same time, we recognize that all of these movements, etc. are on-topic.</p>
<p>So, I propose the following rule on political symbols:</p>
<ul>
<li>Political symbols such as flags, coats of arms, party emblems, anthems, battle insignia, etc. should only be included when discussing the specifics of such symbols or how they were displayed and where seeing the symbol is necessary to fully understand the content or topic under discussion. Questions that simply reference a symbol and ask a general question about it or the movement behind it should not include a copy of the symbol.</li>
</ul>
<p>This definition sidesteps the question of how controversial a symbol is. Showing a Confederate Stars-and-Bars battle flag in a question about the history of Virginia politics is as inappropriate as posting a Dutch flag in a question about the history of regulation of EU fisheries. If you see such a flag, edit it out. If a user continues to add unnecessary flags to posts, raise a moderator flag on one of the posts so we can deal with it. Don't engage in an edit war.</p>
<p>So, here are some concrete examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;What reasons did the Virginia General Assembly give for formally supporting the Confederacy?&quot; - No flag required. If a flag is included, edit it out as fluff.</li>
<li>&quot;Was a Confederate flag ever officially flown at Fauquier County, Virginia public schools?&quot; - No flag required. If a flag is included, edit it out as fluff.</li>
<li>&quot;I bought this Virginia Volunteer Militia uniform from an estate auction in Fredericksburg, Virginia. I noticed that the Stars-and-Bars cap insignia is copper rather than brass as I have seen in local museums. Does this have a particular military or political meaning or is it just due to using whatever metals were available at the time of manufacture?&quot; - It would be appropriate to add a picture of the cap, including the flag insignia.</li>
</ul>

<p>Questions of the form</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is X considered Y?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>represent an inherent problem.  <em>who</em> considers X to be Y?  History, like most sciences, is about constructing models to answer questions.  Historians construct models &amp; theories to fit the evidence in the hope of providing greater insight to some set of questions.</p>
<p>The question &quot;Why is X considered Y&quot;, conceals <em>who</em> considers X to be Y and under what conditions and in what model.  If the historian advocating this theory is a specialist in women's history, then the model may not be the ideal model to understand an economic issue.  Similarly, if the question is about gender roles, then Marxist economic models might not be appropriate.   If the historian who advanced the notion that X is considered Y is a Whig historian, then we need to consider certain biases.</p>

<p>First off, this is effectively a Holocaust question, because one can't really separate how these events shook out from the Holocaust. We have a documented higher quality bar for Holocaust questions. They can't really be problematic in any way shape or form and expect to remain open.</p>
<p>The question contains what appear to be misleading and incorrect assertions with no references (paragraph 4). Not a good combo at all with a Holocaust question.</p>
<p>And lastly, this is a bit more fuzzy, but it looks like it might be an attempt to draw answerers into an argument, rather that a legit request for historical clarification.

<p>I'll concede that the title is somewhat broad. But I did my best to suggest objective, factual methods of answering it that can follow formulas actually in use.</p>

<li><p>Suggestion 1: How many &quot;extra&quot; men were there on the gunboats that were assisting Grant, but technically not under his direct command?</p>
<p>This is a matter of record, except that I don't have access to these records.</p>

<li><p>Suggestion 2: Instead of comparing &quot;men,&quot; compare the firepower of the guns on the gunboats versus that of Grant's 24,000 infantry.</p>
<p>Someone at West Point or Annapolis would probably know the answer to this question.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Suggestion 3: Estimate the value of artillery as a force multiplier. This is a bit more subjective than the first two, but war game makers do this from time to time. That is, they create rules like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Artillery increases the attackers' odds from one to one to two to one. Air power increases them to four to one.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While these are necessarily &quot;guesstimates,&quot; they are grounded in historical records. At the highest level, the Pentagon has powerful simulators for war games.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Suggestion 4 was just a &quot;catchall&quot; so I won't discuss it further.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And the question was not &quot;What are the true odds…&quot; (an opinion) but &quot;How do people guesstimate the &quot;true&quot; odds…?&quot; (factual).</p>

<p>The truth is that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Donelson"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fort Donelson</a> was woefully unprepared for an overland assault; doomed to fall quickly to any competent, determined, and aggressive assault.

There was no fallback position from the outer perimeter except retreat into the fort proper combined with surrender (or as attempted unsuccessfully, breakout) by 80% of the defensive force; but even that buys only a few extra days.</p>

<p>General Simon Bolivar Buckner, however, argued that they were in a desperate position that was getting worse with the arrival of Union reinforcements. At their final council of war in the Dover Hotel at 1:30 a.m. on February 16, Buckner stated that if C.F. Smith attacked again, he could only hold for thirty minutes, and he estimated that the cost of defending the fort would be as high as a seventy-five percent casualty rate. Buckner's position finally carried the meeting. Any large-scale escape would be difficult. Most of the river transports were currently transporting wounded men to Nashville and would not return in time to evacuate the command.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of all the text blurbs I see there, the skeptics one really stands out: &quot;We live in a world of superstition, urban legend, and “fake news”. Skeptics Stack Exchange is dedicated to taking widely-believed claims and subjecting them to scientific skepticism to see what the evidence supports. The scope of the questions is broad – from the serious to the common-place to the bizarre​​. What the answers have in common is we work to push past politics and opinion to get to the empirical facts.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least to me, that communicates an enthusiastic community with a purpose, and I'd like to see us craft something like that.</p>
<p>I think that H:SE is more than a Q&amp;A site - I think we're a distinctive historical research tool.  I think we're a place where you can get help on history and historiography, a place where volunteers are willing to research topics that are difficult or impossible to research through traditional methods.</p>

(and please feel free to remind me of this the next time I throw shade at a bad question; while the question may be very bad, it is an opportunity for an answer that demonstrates research, and ultimately educates.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I think we're good at <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/q/42176/1401"">foundational historiographic questions</a>  - the how to of historical studies that are essential to understanding how history is known.</p>

<p>As we say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new one, we have <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=%22year+in+moderation%22+is%3Aquestion"">a tradition of sharing moderation stats for the preceding calendar year</a>.</p>
<p>As most of you here are aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.<br />
-- <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"">A Theory of Moderation</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't eliminate the need for having <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/"">moderators</a> altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.</p>
<p>So as we say goodbye to 2021, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KZntT.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>exciting</em> stats</a>.

<p>² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.</p>
<p>³ A &quot;destroyed&quot; user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user"">Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.</a></p>
<p>⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.</p>
<p>⁵ Includes close flags (but <em>not</em> close or reopen votes).</p>
<p>⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.</p>
<p>⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).</p>

<p>I grew up in the USSR. I read the book <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1984</a> in the year 1984 (it was a set of photographs, page by page, of a book printed in the West and smuggled into the USSR).
My only source of information were Soviet newspapers, and, occasionally, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Europe/Radio_Liberty"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">western radio</a> (only when I was outside of Moscow, where the western radio was jammed).</p>
<p>I had to learn to infer what was going on in the world by &quot;correcting&quot; Soviet propaganda.
I thought I was good at that.</p>
<p>Later, when the Iron Curtain fell, I was shocked to find out how <em><strong>under</strong></em>-correcting I was.</p>
<h1>1984 in 2009</h1>
<p>After the <a href=""https://www.theregister.com/2009/07/18/amazon_removes_1984_from_kindle/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1984 Kindle debacle</a>, I decided that I will never get a Kindle because this <em>capability</em> to delete what the user thinks she owns is unacceptable to me.</p>
<h1>Today</h1>
<p>The link in the previous paragraph works today, but I have no reason to believe that it will still work tomorrow, or, worse yet, that it will <em>say</em> tomorrow the same thing is did today or 12 years ago.</p>
<p>Given that <a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2022/01/the-bbc-quietly-censors-its-own-archives/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The BBC Quietly Censors Its Own Archives</a>, how reliable are the texts we routinely rely upon on the internet?</p>
<p>Yes, normally, when publishers modify old stories, they explain what they changed (e.g., &quot;corrected the spelling of the names&quot;), but we have no reason to trust them.</p>
<p>Yes, we can refer to each link along with a timestamp (&quot;downloaded on such and such date&quot;), and then use <a href=""http://web.archive.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the internet archive</a>, but even they can be hacked (or worse, organizationally corrupted).</p>
<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p>Unlike the paper sources of the previous millennia, the current digital sources are <em>not</em> tamper resistant. Their &quot;owners&quot; have just as many incentives to censor them as before, but now the 1984-style &quot;corrections of the past&quot; are technologically feasible for the fist time.</p>
<h1>Solutions?</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>One way to deal with this &quot;long term&quot; is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blockchain</a>-style <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">version control</a> of the internet archive.</p>
</li>
<li><p>However, until this is somehow implemented, we have to rely on the internet archive as is...</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>Meanwhile</h1>
<p>User <em>A</em> asks a question and user <em>B</em> replies, citing a Wikipedia article.
Wikipedia page is very clear on the topic, but the relevant sentence is marked with <em>source missing for 1234 days</em>. Oops.</p>
<p>Or <em>A</em> is lucky and Wiki does have a source. It's a dead link. Not in the internet archive. Oops.</p>
<p>Or the source is a book by a well-known author. But the page number is missing - will <em>A</em> get and read the whole book to check?</p>
<h1>Ultimately</h1>
<p>Despite all my whining above, we are in a much <strong>better</strong> epistemological position than ever before.</p>
<p>However, we are grossly overestimating how good our situation is, and we are at risk of losing our advantages, unless we make sure that history cannot be modified 1984-style.</p>

<p>Prior to the printing press, everything had to be hand-copied. Of course nothing done manually is going to be error-free, and in fact inevitably there were changes, insertions, and deletions from copy to copy. Most such changes would be minor, but some were major. Some changes were innocent, some not so much. Even innocent errors would have a inherent vector in the direction of being less surprising and more socially-acceptable (to the copyist). And of course stuff people liked reading would be more likely to get saved and copied, and thus continue to exist as manuscripts aged.</p>
<p>Analysis of this kind of thing, and making inductions about what the originals might have looked like, is what we call <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_criticism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Textual Criticism</a>, and its an important part of the study of history.</p>
<p>Perhaps for the last few hundred years (since Gutenberg), some people may have gotten the idea of eternally perfect original copies of a popular work could be an attainable thing. But that's an ahistorical idea. If you're worried now that the concept might be slipping away, console yourself that Humanity managed to get along without it through most of recorded history.</p>

<ul>
<li>personal impression of ad-hoc/heuristic mental 'stats'</li>
<li>'official statistics' as presented by site-analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the things mentioned, perhaps needed for more insight:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many unregistered users posting decide to register?</li>
<li>How many users start earning reps from non-HNQs, 2-or-more posts?</li>
<li>How did numbers like these develop over the years?</li>
<li>How many users beomce active for a while, but then seem to leave/become inactive again, just by pure visits to the site?</li>

<ul>
<li>'mere' question-closures (plus subsequent 'staying closed'),</li>
<li>'perceived as nasty' comments or downvotes,</li>
<li>sub-par answers, unanswered questions, (what else)?</li>
</ul>
<p>One factor probably being at work here is a variation of your son's suspicion: the higher the rep of a user, the lower the tendency of that very user to ask questions.<br />
So that might be a harvest effect while SE itself and overall approaches a slow-down or even ceiling in new user recruitment? Certainly this downward trend occurs to me on some other sites on which I have analytics privileges.</p>
<p>But this and things like SEDE queries need more insight from staff. Or some clever queries by more SEDE experienced users. If anyone with the skills and motivation for more insight comes along and reads this: please share your results!</p>
<p>One aspect apparently lacking from the statistics in this question is 'how many questions were deleted?'. That would be quite a distortion of post mortem analysis. If we received much more posts but also got even more so 'much better' at deleting questions, then the observed trend might not be an indicator of 'reduced activity' at all but a rather different situation: simply 'us' sieving out more posts.</p>
<p>But It seems that this is covered by current site-analytics. But one aspect for this, <em>albeit not broken down between questions and answers,</em> is to be gleaned from &quot;20xx a year in moderation posts&quot;, which sadly only started appearing in 2018:</p>
<div class=""s-table-container"">
<table class=""s-table"">

</div>
<p>So, while we see a steady increase in post deletions prior to 2021 (with a perhaps seen as welcome trend of community taking a bigger share from 'moderator-duties'), the drastic slump in 2021 seems to rule out ''better' at deletion' as a big explainer for this trend.</p>
<p>At this point I can only repeat that 'hidden' statistics, available to staff, need to be analysed as well.</p>
<p>One step into this direction might be to suggest or even demand a more fine-grained statistic section from &quot;20xx a year in moderation&quot;? Like: also adding a section on general statistics and site activity?</p>

It would be titled as &quot;<em>Why are the casualties on both sides in the Ukrainian war so low compared to past full-scale invasions?</em>, but the specifics don't matter much, you can consider this question in general.</p>
<p>The thing is, it literally started yesterday, so while technically it's history, it's also not quite that. Yet, I feel that this site is a good place to ask it: the answer would need historical knowledge, a strategical and circumstantial comparison between Ukraine and the wars of the past, like the Gulf War or WW2 Blitzkriegs, and the event itself is no doubt of historical significance. In a few decades, I feel this would be a perfect question.</p>
<p>But can we ask such questions about ongoing events of historical significance? Such questions are mostly asked on Politics.SE, but I feel this one would be a poor fit. There's no politics in Ukraine, there is war, and my question is about strategy, tactics and circumstances. In my opinion, this site is more well-equipped to answer this question, but would it welcome it?</p>

<p>One thing that may not be obvious at first sight is that initial reports are quite likely to be far different than the data historians find once the dust has settled and they get a chance to take a full and complete look at the available sources. This goes particularly for this event, where there's sadly rather a lot of cynical propaganda out there masquerading as legitimate news or internet discussion.</p>
<p>This is a prime reason why I'd argue that the Politics site is much better equipped to deal with that kind of question. The users there are much more accustomed to dealing the pitfalls of looking at fresh unprocessed data than we are.</p>
<p>Now someone I suppose might be <em>inspired by current events</em> to ask a question about history (for example historical casualty data for other invasions). We've <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/4410/was-the-us-navy-larger-in-1917-and-if-so-why"">had those</a> in the past.

That is pretty darn close to a propaganda statement, and should rightly earn a one-way ticket to a &quot;promote or discredit&quot; question hold.</p>

<p>The answers to those questions may be useful.</p>
<p>In my opinion (see #include below), a question is a historical question if you use historical sources and methods for analysis.  We don't have any reliable sources from the current conflict. (and, as an aside, I wonder if future historians will need to adapt historical methods to compensate for current trends in mis/dis/information?)  I'd also argue that historical methods aren't well suited for analysis of dynamic, evolving situations (that isn't to say that it is impossible to use them; just that there may be other tools that are better).</p>
<p>The distinction between politics and history is a bit like the distinction between dance and movement; the more skilled the performer the more obvious the distinction.  I move, but I wouldn't call myself a dancer (one of the few opinions I hold that would meet with nearly universal agreement).  History, like dance, is a verb.</p>

</ul>
<p>These are not &quot;light&quot; works: Almquist goes into four volumes which each have sub-volumes of their own; Munthe comes together at about seven volumes.

<p>More precisely, albeit less tersely, the question aggregates groups in a way that the answer is going to be misleading and perhaps misinformative. Not necessarily wrong, but not right.</p>
<p>For example<sup>1</sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did Europeans benefit from the scramble for Africa?</li>
<li>Did polytheistic religions believe that other pantheons existed?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's examine each of these in turn</p>
<h2> Did Europeans benefit from the scramble for Africa </h2> 
<p>&quot;Europeans&quot; conceals more than it reveals. Substitute other aggregates e.g. or &quot;people with O+ blood&quot; – the statistical correlation won't advance our understanding of history unless there is some theory that links the agency of the aggregate to the outcome. This may seem like a nitpick, but I think the ambiguity that results hampers our understanding of history. What if the question were &quot;Did European women benefit from investment in Africa?&quot; – the difference in agency between &quot;European women&quot; and &quot;Europeans&quot; significantly changes the question.</p>
<p>There exists a politically inclined cluster of historians who would challenge this on &quot;European economic elites&quot; vs &quot;Europeans&quot; - That particular classification doesn't help me to understand history; I suspect that the underlying models are misleading and pejorative as often as not, but if the analysis is carried out rigorously, it is probably better than &quot;Europeans&quot;</p>
<p>It might be interesting to rephrase the question as &quot;What segments of European civilization benefited most from the scramble for Africa?&quot; – examine the benefits from the Scramble for Africa(SfA), and trying different demographic models to see how closely they tie to economic benefits, and then constructing a theory that would explain that, and then trying to test the predictive value of that theory. Were the benefits of SfA more closely correlated with economic or political elites?</p>
<h2> Did polytheistic religions believe that other pantheons existed? </h2>
<p>First off, <strong>polytheistic</strong> is a misleading term; as discussed in <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/monotheism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Britannica</a>, there are multiple underlying assumptions, Internal vs external, intellectual vs cultural, etc. Religion belief is a complex topic and Wallaces N'th corollary<sup>3</sup> to Whited's first law <sup>2</sup> applies. Let's look at a couple of examples:<sup>4</sup></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Romans vs Egyptians – the Roman (polytheistic) embraced/enclosed the Egyptian pantheon. Romans worshiped foreign gods. Worship of foreign gods might have been a cultural disadvantage, but was not punished directly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Romans vs Greeks – The Roman (polytheistic) religion directly incorporated Greek gods, treating them as equivalencies</p>
</li>
<li><p>Romans vs Jews/Christians – The Romans punished those of a different religion (perhaps because of incompatible religion, perhaps because they violated social order, perhaps because the foreign cult was exclusionary in a way that was incompatible with the Roman worship and governance; this is complicated and I'm not going to explain why (at least not successfully), I'm just going to offer it as an example.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Shinto vs Buddhism, vs Confucianism – I lack the scholarship to discuss this fully, but these three religions strike different social accords in different cultures and different times in Asia/South Asia.  I believe there are times when they conflict violently, but for the majority of time they work in harmony.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Egyptian <a href=""https://www2.nau.edu/%7Egaud/bio301/content/heno.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Henotheism</a> – This is one of my favorite words; I understand the fundamental theory is narrowly supported by few scholars and may be flawed, but it represents a different approach between polytheistic religions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The point is that different <em>particular</em> polytheistic religions deal differently with different <em>particular</em> polytheistic religions at different places and times. Aggregating them together and treating all Polytheistic religions as the same will lead to a misunderstanding of religion and religious conflict.</p>
<p>I've got a very limited background, but I think religious conflict is more influenced by particular details (ritual, political engagement, etc.) than by the single variable &quot;polytheistic/non-polytheistic&quot;, even if we were to come up with some kind of authoritative definition of that variable.</p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li>As usual, I do not intend to criticize the authors of these questions; I'm merely citing them as illustrative examples.</li>
<li>&quot;It's more complicated than that&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;making complex things simple can make them wrong&quot; – this is a corollary to &quot;Everything should be as simple as possible but no simpler&quot;, and a counterargument against <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Box's law of Models</a>.  The point is that all analysis is based on assumptions and models; choosing the wrong model will lead to misleading or wrong outcomes.</li>
<li>These are all vastly oversimplified and not sourced; these are illustrative examples. I have neither the time nor the scholarship to do the topics justice, but I think they suffice to illustrate the point.</li>

<p>This is a deceptively interesting question. I suspect that studying migration from the metropole to the colony is meaningless unless the migration is broken down into demographic groups. Different groups will have different motivations, but how to select demographics for further study?</p>

<p>So, what, I have to ask one question per demographic?</p>

<p>You're correct, <strong>I should have updated the edit history.</strong>  I apologize for the omission.</p>
<p>Although you and I don't perceive the word as problematic, the history of the HNQ list demonstrates that there exists a minority of people whose behavior is determined by different definitions of &quot;problematic&quot;.  SE in general has had ...disproportionate... responses to specific words in the HNQ list.  I don't have the data to model the SE community, but my operational model is that there is some subset of the community who scours the HNQ looking for words that they perceive as prurient, descending on the community and reacting to the word without reading the rest of the question.  I'm sad to say that when I went back to find a link to the original controversy (which was not on H:SE, but another site), I can't find it - there are too many examples of questions that had to be removed from HNQ because the only way to manage problem behavior is to make very conservative assumptions about what words are problematic.</p>
<p>The word isn't against any policy or guidance - but when that word appears on the HNQ list, I feared that it would draw attention that would detract from the value of the question to the history community.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the question is a well formed, a well researched question  about the use of a term in a historical/legal context. In fact, I believe this is the kind of question at which H:SE excels; questions where some context can unlock the meaning of historical text.  I wanted to ensure that the question drew attention for the historical value, not for potentially prurient value.</p>

<p>For those with some knowledge of legal concepts, I consider the rule to relate to <em>procedural</em> matters rather than <em>substantive</em> matters. For example, a question doesn't automatically become off-topic if it veers into the Holocaust just because the Holocaust is somehow off-topic, it just receives extra attention and care and moderators are less likely to give it the benefit of the doubt. As a moderator, I generally defer the closure of most questions to the community (even if I believe they should be closed), hammering closed only the most egregiously bad questions (e.g. &quot;O hi, what is George Washington's birthday??? Also, was he a good person? I need it for school thx.&quot;). The main exception to this is for questions on controversial topics, which I will evaluate and close if I am not convinced they are on-topic, specific, and asked in good faith.</p>

<p>Thanks for posting on History Stack Exchange! Let's look at the question for a moment.</p>
<p>Here is the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I read about how Rome mass murder carthagians and jews.</p>
<p>I always wonder, short of fighting and killing romans and winning at it, what are the ways carthagians and people in ancient time, can avoid being killed?</p>
<p>Some things I can think of is not flaunting wealth. The Carthagians paid off war compensation too early. They should have postponed paying it as much as possible. A lot of debt is good.</p>
<p>It is possible that the romans want to kill Carthagians because they are rich.</p>
<p>Another mistake would have been to try for peace too much. If Carthagians don't give weapons to e roman general, they would have been more able to defend themselves.</p>
<p>Or do they?</p>
<p>What could they have done?</p>
<p>Note: Some people think that I wanted to &quot;blame&quot; Carthagian. The truth is the opposite. I am saddened that trade civilization like Carthagians are slaughtered. I wonder if they could have done this differently so anyone in their position could have survived.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all, it asserts a genocide but provides no sources for it. You say you &quot;read about&quot; this. Was this on Wikipedia? Did you find it in a high school history textbook? Did you read it in a journal or magazine? Is this from someone's blog?</p>
<p>Second, it asks us to speculate how this genocide (that we aren't even clear about) could have been avoided. That might be an interesting debate topic but isn't a question that we can answer using historical methods.</p>
<p>Third, the question, covering Jews and genocide, falls within our <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3684/21290"">controversial topics</a> policy, in which these questions have a &quot;hair-trigger for being put on hold&quot;. It must affirmatively demonstrate good faith and research or the question will be closed. It is true that most of its focus is on Carthaginians rather than Jews, but that does not change the fact that most of the question is, in fact, a victim-blaming question that is little more than, &quot;Why don't victims of genocide fight back?&quot;. That's not something that we do here and not something we have any interest in doing. Asserting that a victim-blaming question is not one is the same as pointing to an elephant and calling it a duck. It doesn't work and it undermines the credibility of all its other claims.</p>
<p>If you could edit the question to add reliable sources (e.g. a history textbook, a journal article, etc.) and narrow down the question to something that can be reasonably answered, you may post on Meta or flag your question and we can undelete it so that it can go through the reopening process.</p>

<p>The question appears to ask about human history, but is based on assumptions that apply only to historical Europe.  If the question is scoped to all of human history, the answer will almost inevitably be so broad as to require a book length answer (and therefore be out of scope for H:SE).</p>
<p>This is an opportunity for comments to clarify if OP is asking for a book length survey of human history, or if scoping the question to a particular culture, (or geography, or time) would yield a satisfactory answer.</p>

Which I quote and try to understand one by one</p>
<blockquote>
<p>India is nine times the size of Germany, and roughly the size of Europe west of a line from Szczecin (Stettin) to Venice; an area which is home to the major languages of French, Portuguese, Spanish, German, and Italian as well as a host of minor languages. On what basis do you expect a heavily populated area that large and diverse to NOT have many languages?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no idea why this comment was written. I do not think no where in the post I said I expected Indian state only to have one language. I simply asked, why northern side speaks more than southern.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This question really needs some initial research (at least), and the use 'Hindi' needs some clarification. Try looking at Hindi language. –</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are of course places where this is discussed, eg this <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Hindi-spoken-mostly-in-the-northern-and-middle-India"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">quora</a> thread but it doesn't have any trust worthy reference. The purpose of me asking in this site is to get more reputed answers which are sourced.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you asking specifically about speaking Hindi at all, or are you asking about native languages? The chart you posted seems to include second language speakers, but it is not clear from your question whether you are including those. –</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I simply asked, why more fraction of people speak Hindi in northern state than other. I never put an additional condition if it is as native language or not. So, I don't understand why the commentors are stuck up on this.</p>

<p>At present, the best answer I can give to a simple &quot;why&quot; question like that is <strong>&quot;Why not?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>In other words, why <em>wouldn't</em> things be that way? They have to be <em>some</em> way, right? What's at all odd about it? Perhaps if you can edit the question text to answer my &quot;Why not?&quot; question, you'd have a more answerable H.SE question on your hands?</p>

<p>Speculation section -
I <em>think</em> you are trying to do one of two things here:</p>
<p>Guess 1: You meant to be asking something along the lines of &quot;How did the modern distribution of Hindi come to be?&quot; (which honestly demands a novel, not an answer here), or perhaps &quot;Why did Hindi become dominant over so much of the Subcontinent, but never got any further south?&quot; (not a bad question there IMHO)</p>
<p>Guess 2: You've actually got a bit of an agenda, and any answers that call back into the current consensus history/linguistics/archeology picture of Hindi being an Indo-European language that migrated in with its speakers from the Eurasian heartland of that language family, will be jumped on and argued. In fact the question was perhaps a prompt for inducing this exact argument, rather than a serious question.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if Guess 2 is insulting, but we really get people like that here, and as a new user, for all we know you're one of those. Questions that are likely fodder for such people tend to get extra scrutiny, and tend to be put on hold much more quickly.</p>

<p>These are in my opinion <em>different</em> questions ('specific data point' vs 'methodology/howto'. Thus not really 'duplicates'?</p>
<p>This idea seems also motivated due to recent &quot;spate of questions&quot; that had answers ranging between 'easy/quick to find' to 'difficult to find ' and even 'impossible to know'. Well, if an answer was posted…</p>
<p>I see only the 'too easy'/'too basic' questions as problematic. A specific close reason for that already exists. A link to a 'method'-dupe may only be useful for <em>these?</em></p>
<p>It seems further noteworthy that 'the spate' seems to have been originating from <em>one</em> specific new user. As long as that user keeps the cadence of this type of question at this rather low level (not multiple questions of this type per day!), and the formal question quality raised by nudging the user a bit more towards our quality goals, the problem seems to be more 'boredom of regular —but uninterested— users'? That is 'the problem' could also be phrased 'not enough interesting new questions posted'?

<p>Note that <em>if</em> there are <em>different problems</em> than 'on-topic but (somehow) disliked questions', <em>then different</em> tactics/solutions should be sought to deal with a possibly problematic specific user, rather than preventing answers to a type of question others have asked (sparingly), and which we allowed without a hinch, and should allow without much second thoughts, especially for 'famous persons'?</p>

<p>I suppose closing the 'too basic' questions as is, <em>and having a meta-post</em> about methodology linked to in comments might be a better and more eductaional solution than using 'duplicates' to prevent specific answers?</p>

<p>To this duplicate proposal of &quot;Does this answer your question?&quot; I commented below the more recent one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interesting, since the proposed dupe might be technically 'a similar question', but it surely does not have very good, or for this: even a valid answer to this particular Q ('dupe'-A: 'here is one English book'…). On other SEs I have seen the practice of marking the older Q as 'the dupe', if the newer Q gets the better answers. (Technical &amp; grammar, logic issues of the resulting banner notice aside…)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The linked and supposed duplicate clearly <em>does not</em> 'answer' the question posed now. The question posed is for speeches in <em>'original German'</em> and was answered rather comprehensively for multiple venues assessed for their quality — whereas the supposed dupe got only a low-effort stub of an answer for one dubious <em>English</em> source found by the answer writer.</p>
<p>(Even more concerning is the quality of the supposed duplicate's answer: so low an effort went into it that the very low effort's description makes up most of its text. And there was <em>zero</em> source quality evaluation: the one file found by random internet search turns out to be an unreliable neo-nazi collection, advertising on its last page a neo-nazi site, with the linked on a History:SE PDF file signed off by its editor as: &quot;Made by Propagandaleiter&quot;! Without any warning or evaluation of that 'source'. While the source material sought by either question is by its very nature nazi-related, this kind of sloppiness is quite off-smelling. That goes as well towards those recommending that answer instead of the newer one.)</p>
<p>To compare other site's established policy for marking  which post as what in questions about duplicates, <a href=""https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3199/251859"">one example from a mod on a different SE site:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When both questions have been asked more than a year before now, I’m less likely to close in the direction linking to the oldest question and more in favor of closing in the best direction - favoring the question with the best phrasing, best answer or answer diversity and tie going to the shortest, clearest phrasing of the question at hand.</p>
<p>In this case, we’re closing towards a canonical question so that is even more correct in my eyes regardless of typical or general case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I see it here, we're closing a question as 'duplicate' now <em>despite</em> the supposed dupe not having a valid answer to the 'new' —and different— question, <em>and</em> we close towards a far inferior target.</p>
<p>As for the process and supposed 'community decisions' resulting in the present closed state: we also see a review queue process that resulted in 'the community decision' with three votes in favour to 'Leave Open'. That answers to the newer question are indeed more helpful is what the automated system says: <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/tools/post-feedback/most-helpful?filter=day"">The newer question also is currently listed with a top spot on &quot;Most Helpful&quot; on the site-tools 'day' tab.</a></p>
<p>So,</p>

<li><p>This is not a real duplicate, certainly not an 'exact duplicate'. Thus it should be reopened.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Even if it were any form of duplicate, since it seems SE policy requires to merge/close <em>towards</em> answers, better answers, and thus towards the newer question. Thus it should be reopened and <em>perhaps</em> (see 1.: 'no real duplicate') the other question marked as a dupe.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Taking into account the above arguments: This decision should be reversed, this is not a real duplicate, and if it is still judged as duplicate, then it should be closed towards the better answers?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Plainly superfluous, chatty, 'incorrect info giving comments' are left standing far too often. (In case an argument should come up like 'users need to flag those': Going back through my declined flags, the last two were 1. a primitive misunderstanding on a question's topic, rectified by a clarifying edit made to the question obsoleting the comment, 2. a chatty comment responding with incorrect info on another comment that responded on another incorrect info as well. That was 3 levels of 'not improving the question' left standing, to this day). It seems to me 'no-longer-needed' is a flag one can forget about entirely, as <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/601/26786"">others noted a long time ago</a>.

<p>Don't we have far too many half-answers in comments, for which the  official SE policy is: don't do that!? At all!</p>
<p>It's a big problem to see an utterly incorrect half-answer comment get double the upvotes than a full-on correct high quality answer posted at roughly the same time.</p>
</li>

<h1>Good comments disappearing</h1>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><p>Some posts are egregiously bad. Even if they seem to appear fine on first look. Many users just reading along, not checking the arguments made, and certainly far too seldom checking up on the links vote very superficially. That is bad. These posts need at least some comments to point out the flaws. That is what 'when should I comment'-help says to do, that is what the post notice &quot;may be disputed&quot; implies.</p>
<p>Some posts are in need of correcting comments <em>below</em> them! (Meta had this topic <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4152/26786"">before</a>) We <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3947/26786"">also need more post notices for 'citation please'.</a> If a flag requesting such a notice comes up, the banner should follow. My impression is that mods apply those notices on their own whim, if <em>they, the mods</em> have complaints about a post, but decline most flags in that direction?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>Abusing the emergent system</h1>
<ol start=""3"">
<li><p>Moderators lately <em>abuse</em> the 'move to chat function' — and at the same time have complained about 'users not posting to chat but continuing to post below a post'.</p>
<p>— 3.1. The first 'abuse' is that apparently there is an alert going off for a threshold of comments. Mods <em>here</em> then sweep in, move all of the stuff to chat. No pruning, no quality assessment to keep some comments attached to the post. Sorry, this is automatism, best done by a bot, and frankly: lazy. There are many many comments that do not need any conservation. And there are many important additions, criticisms etc that are far better and much more useful if left below the post.</p>
<p>The '20 comments alert and now move' is also not 'the law': around the SE network we can see posts that <em>on purpose</em> have <em>much</em> more comments below a post left standing for long time. Why? Because they <em>are</em> useful, and seen as such by mods, so they make exceptions.</p>
<p>— 3.2. The second abuse is that some mods 'move to chat' <em>very short</em> comment threads, also most of the time without any pruning leaving a message that says: &quot;Comments are not for <em>extended discussion</em>&quot;, when in reality there are/were usually less than 10 comments made. In each and every instance this was evidently <em>not</em> an extended discussion. It seems some mods became somehow scared and want to avoid any form of controversy? But the effect is that</p>
<p>—— 3.2.1. Those chat rooms with less than 20 (?) overall messages do not just get 'frozen' after a while, but outright <em>deleted!</em> That fact <em>alone proves</em> that there was <em>no</em> extended &quot;discussion&quot; in the first place. It also achieves the opposite effect of 'preserving the comments in chat', obviously.</p>
<p>If that is the <em>intended effect</em> mods <em>want:</em> then why not either state that plainly in the comment message that goes along the move2chat?</p>
<p>Like: &quot;I the mod want this discussion which I consider fruitless anyway to die in an abandoned/detached chatroom that's scheduled for deletion, but you guys have a few days to see how bad it all went down in the comments; and, if you insist can still participate in this mess&quot;<br />
That is understandable, even transparent to a degree, and honest. Move to chat with just six messages and this auto-comment is not honest.</p>
<p>Better yet: why not outright <em>delete</em> those comments? Those <em>offending</em> comments? Since <em>some</em> comments <em>should stay,</em> and some of those should <em>stay attached!</em><br />
Yeah, perhaps difficult to decide, maybe more work, complaints also guaranteed for that. But in my view: still an improvement?</p>
<p>—— 3.2.2. This effect is obviously also abused by certain users. Or is mod behaviour abused by those users? Those users that are prone to post things like &quot;this is not a forum&quot;, but comment amply on other posts, make chatty comments, respond to comments that respond to comments; in short: users that are prone to indeed engage in extended discussion in comments. But those users start kicking and screaming, with ad hominem and personalised <em>attacks,</em> if their posts are commented on in what they perceive as 'negativity'. These comments are designed to escalate, not confirming to any expected conduct, and show 1. that these users cannot control themselves, and that these violations are selectively, and thereby arbitrarily enforced. (Archive of screenshots, actual usernames, <em>and still working links omitted for now.</em> It's a shame that personalised attacks and a barrage of plain insults were in effect useful to get this user's wishes fulfilled).</p>
<p>Those users do not like the flaws of their posts pointed out in comments, accuse others of 'spamming the comments', and then flood the comments, apparently counting on the mods removing the entire thread, either by direct deletion of: 1. factual, neutral, 'about the post &amp; not the person', and <em>needed</em> correcting comments; or by 2: <em>indiscriminate</em> move to chat, with leaving valid comments below post or prior pruning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>What is to be done now?</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>an update from mods on the current situation: what are the implicit policies, tendencies, rationales?</p>
</li>
<li><p>input from non-mod users about the current state and intended goal of our comment policies</p>

<li><p><strong>That premature move-to-chat just stops!</strong> If an alert goes off, first <em>prune</em> the comments. Only if there is indeed 'a chat' developing, and is either semi-useful, or 'interesting', <em>and</em> above the resulting threshold for a room to <em>not</em> auto-dlete, <em>then</em> move to chat.<br />
But leave useful, needed, on-topic &amp; on-puropse (improving the post) comments as much in place as much as anyhow possible!</p>

(Because this is complex, I'm going to quickly write a first draft, then if I have time, come back and revise.)</p>
<p>This is a good question, full of thought, but I think it is based on some assumptions that I don't share, and omits some priorities that I value.</p>
<p>Comments are largely <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3631/1401"">barn cats</a>. We welcome the value they provide, but they are not investment goods.  The site exists to support Questions &amp; Answers; those are our capital, and that's where we want to invest our efforts.  The primary reason for comments is to request clarifications or improvements to Questions or Answers. After that, they should be deleted.</p>
<p>Distinguishing between a good comment and a bad comment is difficult.  Pruning comments - selectively deleting - is very difficult.  Reading through the entire comment string and identifying which comments support the flagged pattern, vice which comments <strong>both</strong> support a better question <strong>and</strong> can be separated from the other comments in the string without losing context is very difficult.</p>
<p>Very frequently a comment is flagged for degrading the site - either because it is abusive, or for some other reason. In almost every case, the flagged comment is the <em>result</em> of a conversation (argument) in comments. If I delete only the flagged comment the underlying dispute remains and one of the involved parties will feel compelled to continue the discussion.  The root problem isn't the comment, it is the discussion in comments.  Discussion in comments is bad.</p>
<p>Pruning comments is far more difficult than the last bullet suggests.  Every comment I prune is going to be an affront to the person who left that comment. That person believes that their comment wasn't just valid, but was <em>more important</em> than the other comments in the string, and they will resent the culling.  The culling also makes it much more difficult to understand the comment string as a whole.  Context is lost, which leads people to make erroneous assumptions.</p>
<p>Most of the H:SE users are pretty sharp folks - while we have some personalities, the most frequent cause of dispute is differing perspectives.  A Marxist historian is going to weight evidence differently than I do and come to different conclusions.  A student of feminist history will have a different perspective - not because they deny that the history I study exists, but because they are trying to draw a focus to specific themes in history.  Moderating a comment stream where the fundamental issue is a difference in perspective is not something I want to do - I don't want to privilege either of those perspectives.  In those cases I'll throw the comment stream to chat and let them work it out.</p>
<p>Finally, dispute is ... not sure I'll express this well, but dispute is negative sum/exponential.  Once a dispute crosses a certain threshold it picks up momentum and risks degrading the rest of the site.  First it will generate additional flags, then it will generate behavior that will result in a significant action (ban, escalation, etc.)  I'd prefer to avoid that escalation; when the dispute crosses the boundary between civility and disrespect, (when it gets flagged), I'm generally going to err on the side of civility.</p>
<p>All of these because comments are barn cats. House cats get to go the vet; barn cats don't.  Review of comments isn't just a vet visit, it is surgery.  We don't schedule barn cats for surgery.  If we invest time and energy in questions &amp; answers, the site improves.  Comments require disproportionate time and energy and don't improve the site nearly as much.</p>
<p>As I said, personal opinion.</p>

<p>I'd say no, the community is not answer shy. Far from it.</p>

<p>We often see answers popping up below questions that are unclear, and phrased misleading ways, and … have quite often numerous other problems.</p>
<p>That shows <em>the need for comments below questions:</em> request clarifications from questions, especially from those that are unclear, like imo this one on main.</p>
<p>What we see here, instead, and what is explicitly shown in this meta-question is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My question received at least 2 comments which could have been answers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being prime evidence for: We do have a constantly growing <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/q/4382/26786"">comments-problem</a>. Namely that comments below questions often are not used to improve the question, but to offload by definition policy violating half-answers. Such comments can be wrong, which they frequently are, and I think they might be here, without the system design's options for gauging their quality: up- <em>and down</em>-voting.</p>
<p>If those comments are 'answers', or 'meant as such', then they should be posted as 'answers', <em>not</em> 'as comments'! If they are half-answers, then by SE-policy they should be deleted.</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>The community culture here is that we have let a trend emerge and then let it kept growing that comments are no longer barn cats, but for far too many users their way of participating: writing half-answers into the comment box, so that there cannot be a perhaps downvoting involving quality control. Not that the voting either here on H:SE or on the rest of SE would be any form of reliable indicator. But on comments: this is an order of magnitude worse.</p>

<p>Here's what I see looking at that question (all times delta from previous time):</p>
<ul>
<li>T<sub>0</sub> - Question asked</li>
<li>+1 hour - Comment posted asking if the Wikipedia page on this very subject answers the question.</li>
<li>+17 mins - Second comment posted providing details from the WP page posted in the previous comment that seems to back up the idea that said page actually answers the question.</li>
<li>+6 hours - Two more comments added discussing nitty details found on that WP page.</li>
<li>+2 hours - One more comment, arguing the question was framed badly.</li>
<li>+1 hour - Questions gets a close vote.</li>
<li>+20 mins - Question gets put on the review queue (which explains the sudden spurt of votes that follows)</li>
<li>+3 mins - Question gets a close vote.</li>
<li>+20 min - Question gets a close vote.</li>
<li>+1 hour - Question gets a close vote (now 1 vote from closure)</li>
<li>+12 hours - Question author responds to two of the questions in the comments, but offers no explanation as to why the WP page doesn't answer the question.</li>
<li>+19 hours - Question gets 5th close vote, and is thus closed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that at no point in the above timeline was the question ever edited to address any of the issues raised in the comments.</p>
<p>So the basic story I'm seeing here is really pretty simple: Users here had questions, particularly about if this question wasn't trivially answered by a standard reference source (Wikipedia in this case), those questions went unaddressed, and it got closed.</p>
<p>As for why it didn't get answers in the meantime, why would it? There were at least 4 users who had issues with the form of the question. Likely they represented far more users who read the question, but didn't say anything about it. Issues make questions much harder to answer (or in some cases make the answer so trivial its a waste of time to bother typing it up). They also tend to get questions closed. Who wants to waste some of the (very finite) remaining hours of their lives researching and composing an answer to a question that is just going to get closed? Far, far better to wait until the issues pointed out get fixed.</p>

This is the link: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNh0heEi1EY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNh0heEi1EY</a>. Not for the first time, I found myself wondering why the focus of the analysis is on the amount of territory controlled, rather than the amount of fight, so to speak, that each nation possesses. The analyst said Ukraine now controls ninety something percent of Kharkiv Oblast. How does that help Ukraine in the longterm, I wondered. That area of ground doesn't contain weapons, soldiers, or any other thing that can be used against the Russians, does it? Surely what determines the outcome is how much military material each side loses or gains, and not territory. In chess, gains are usually gains of material, while the total number of squares controlled is never mentioned. Why is it so different in war?
I Googled the question and could find only stuff about how things related to territory <em>cause</em> war, but nothing about why territory is <em>useful</em> in winning a war. I couldn't find a military strategy SE site. I see that military strategy is discussed on History, and also on Politics, and in computer game and simulation related sites here, too. History seemed to be the most promising, though.</p>
<p>................................................................................</p>
<p>I guess another way of putting the question would be, &quot;Does pushing the enemy back a few kilometers cause the enemy to be more likely to lose the war or does it merely indicate it?&quot; Generals seem to focus on pushing back the enemy, or at least they and everyone else regard as it as a success and I don't see why. &quot;Pushing back&quot; is of course figurative, and it really means causing the enemy to choose to retreat. Napoleon, and Hitler both pushed back the enemy a lot, but the <em>way</em> they pushed the enemy back caused them to lose the war, in each case, or rather, the way the enemy retreated (scorched earth) did, am I right?</p>
<p>One person who posted an answer suspected that I might be here to have argument. While not averse to spirited debate, it wasn't my conscious intention to have an argument here. Also, I don't consider myself knowledgeable about history or military strategy. I am genuinely mystified about the role of &quot;pushing back&quot; the enemy in getting to a final victory. It seems to me that it might be a symptom of progress towards victory rather than a cause of it. To make the enemy retreat you have to damage the enemy's ability to make war, and it's the latter that makes a final victory more likely, not the actual possession of that territory, perhaps?</p>

<ol>
<li>Historiography - Questions about the study of history itself are on topic here, but they tend to be on thin ice. It needs to be pretty clear this is a historiography question, and otherwise a good History question, which makes any further problems it has more serious.</li>
<li>Unsupported assertions - We have a really bad time here with people making all kinds of outlandish assertions and then asking us to somehow base answers on that shaky foundation. Any non-trivial assertions in a question need to be supported. For instance, having a specific link and analysis the question is referring to that we are free to go look at ourselves is great! Asserting that this is the normal/usual way people analyze things with only the one exemplar is not so great.</li>
<li>Unclear question. I'm still not 100% sure what the question would be here. It almost looks like you're looking to argue with the author, or perhaps one of our writers foolishly taking up the author's case, rather than asking a question you'd seriously desire to know the answer to. Our users who answer questions are generally here because they enjoy writing about history to a receptive audience. So if there's a specific question about history you'd like to know the answer to, the text of the <em>question</em> should be explaining clearly what that question is.

<p>History Stack Exchange is for historians and history buffs. If you have a question about:</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Historiography</p>
<p>Then you are in the right place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, at its core it seems like you're trying to draw a line between questions like &quot;what could have happened?&quot;, and questions like &quot;what did X believe could have happened?&quot; or &quot;did anyone think X could have happened?&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;What could have happened&quot; questions just lead to broad, off-topic answers: either we give our own speculation as random StackExchange users, or we cite sources making the same sort of speculation we could do. People could say yes or no based on any number of hypotheticals, all of which could be completely unrelated to what the relevant historical figures knew at the time or what later examinations thought was possible.</p>
<p>However, &quot;what did X believe&quot; questions have only a few on-topic options: either X thought about what could have happened, X didn't think about what could have happened, or we don't know what X thought. Similarly for &quot;did anyone think about X&quot;: either some historical figure thought about X, or there were reasons for thinking X wasn't possible. For these types of questions, it doesn't matter what potentials existed, what historians knew in hindsight, or what we StackExchange users can think of: answers will either cite historical figures' thoughts about some hypothetical, or will try their best to show why the the hypotheticals weren't considered.</p>
<p>So, to use a recent question about an alternative outcome to the WWII Pacific campaign as an example: <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/70370/has-anyone-envisioned-a-wipeout-scenario-for-japan-in-the-pacific-for-world-wa"">Had anyone envisioned a &quot;wipeout&quot; scenario for Japan in the Pacific for World War II?</a></p>

<li>If a question explicitly asks for hypotheticals made by contemporary sources (military leaders of the relevant countries, civilian thinkers/reporters/etc.), then it should be on-topic</li>
<li>If a question asks about post-conflict examinations (later historians, military leaders shortly after the conflict, etc.), then it should be on-topic</li>
<li>If a question asks for hypotheticals that could not have been known at the time (such as future technology advancements/discoveries) or for examinations that that rely on events that didn't happen (if so-and-so succeeded at X, what would they have thought about Y), then it's probably off-topic</li>

<h3>Other points for improvement; ways that the question lacks focus</h3>
<p>In my opinion, there is a completely unnecessary focus and background relating to a chess player and chess.</p>
<p>While telling us what you &quot;understand so far&quot; you ask a question: &quot;The US has been allies with England(/the UK?) since, what, early 1900s latest?

<p>Then you make a statement about what a chess player said about someone else's mental health. I don't see the relevance of this at all.</p>
<p>Then you state your questions, and you ask a bunch of things about what might be included in one person's conception of &quot;allies of evil.&quot; I have no idea how a history site can assist with understanding what one chess player was thinking. If I take your question at face value, this is a categorization that he himself made up and is using in an idosyncratic way.</p>

<p><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/1579/when-and-how-did-the-usa-and-the-uk-become-allies"">The other question</a> asks a single, focused, question <em>about history</em> (albeit phrased in two different ways, but they are clearly the same question):</p>

<p>OTOH, if the AI starts generating <em>good answers</em>, that's a different kettle of fish. Personally, I'm inclined to think a (legally-posted) good answer is a good answer.

<p>I tried out ChatGPT myself and posed it some historical questions. While it did have some basic insights that could be found in a high school history textbook, it was completely incapable of doing any sort of reasoning about more complex topics. When I posed such a question, it would say something like, &quot;There are many possible reasons for [x], some have said [y]....&quot; and then <em>completely fail to cite anyone</em>. Those are low quality answers if I ever saw one.</p>
<p>I did review our New Answers to Old Questions feed under the 10k tools and it looks like our current rate of answers is slow enough that each of then can be manually checked.

<p>Right now, the tag has no tag wiki, and seems to be mostly used for the history of LGBT movements, identity, laws, and tolerance. Should we memorialize this in the tag wiki or should we expand it to cover historical questions that involve LGBT people or relationships but aren't about LGBT history per se?</p>
<p>One possible reason I see for including history of specific LGBT people into the tag is that such questions are likely to be of interest to and be answerable by people who have an interest in LGBT history.</p>

<li>Questions about LGBT relationships, LGBT-ness, and involvement in LGBT movements of specific famous LGBT people in history. These are LGBT questions about historical LGBT people, but not about the history of LGBT.</li>
<li>Questions about a specific LGBT person or LGBT people, but where the question has nothing to do with anything LGBT per se. An example could be a question about what physical building Alan Turing worked in. These are non-LGBT questions about historical LGBT people.</li>

<p>Our main users may <em>attempt</em> to enforce a no-sources/no votes policy, but when a question goes HNQ, we get a large influx of non-site regulars that pop in and vote, often with no knowledge of the policies we try to uphold here. We have all seen poor questions, which later get closed, first reach the HNQ list. <em>If</em> the non-moderators can point to a specific policy in comments, perhaps it might slow down these random votes until moderators can step in. (this would assume of course the AI/content can be recognized as such; I look forward to seeing the tools mentioned by @MCW)</p>
<p>The problem with <em>assuming</em> it will be closed by the users goes back to an old discussion we had here once about bad questions/answers. If it has no sources, but looks <em>ok</em> otherwise, users may not up vote it, but also may not down vote it or move to close.</p>
<p>I would recommend a <em>strict</em> policy in fact, <em>requiring</em> such content be deleted and the suspensions mentioned by T.E.D levied. Remove any incentive to 'play games' with the system simply for the purpose of earning rep.</p>
<p>I watched one video about detecting this type of content, which fed the info into another Ai to evaluate, <a href=""https://huggingface.co/openai-detector/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. In the comments below the video there were already discussions on how to beat the system. Please set a policy now, and get ahead of those individuals.</p>
<p>For those that think this will not be a problem, there is an answer (since deleted by @MCW) from a few days ago, which <em><strong>had 2 upvotes</strong></em>, and only one down vote. It looked <em>ok</em>, so most of the users ignored it. It tests at the above linked site as <em><strong>99.97% probability as fake</strong></em>. (<a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/70481/16951"">deleted answer is here</a>, only visible if you have enough rep to view deleted answers)</p>
<p>Another recent answer (12/17) posted (and then self-deleted) <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/a/70528/16951"">here</a> also fails the test. (Only users with sufficient rep to see deleted answers will see this post).</p>
<p>So you can see this is an ongoing issue. (It is also worth noting both of the examples I cite came to the site with association bonus, so this abuse is not limited to unregistered/new users.)</p>
<p>I will add Steve Bird's comment from below, which also points out another danger of allowing this type of content to go on unchecked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the ChatGPT experiment starts to produce &quot;good enough&quot; answers, it
would also be a tool that could be open to abuse by trolls. As we've
seen in the past, posting a few 'good' answers to build up rep can be
misused to sock puppet and upvote push questions. Being able to
quickly generate an acceptable answer with little effort would be a
boon to them.</p>

One could say he's a central figure in a seminal event (or injustice) in LGBT history, and his historicity as a person is inseparable from that.</p>
<p>On a somewhat related note, I'm a bit uncomfortable with the question, as I can't think of a good reason to ask it, other than quasi-purient interest in the looks of someone who's only known for being the object of desire in a sexual scandal. I don't think there's any legit reason to close a question for that though.</p>

They are usually pretty easy to spot, and of course trying to evade a suspension with a sock account is a TOS violation, so any such sock account will be destroyed on sight.</p>
<p>As was mentioned in the comments there's a difference between accounts that are <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user"">deleted vs. ones that are destroyed</a>. The short of it is that in addition to what deletion does, everything the user created (posts/comments) is also deleted, <em>and</em> their IP address gets blocked.<sup>*</sup>  The other types of users that get this kind of treatment are anyone who posts nothing but spam or nonsense, or does so on their first post from an unregistered account.</p>
<p>For the known trolls, often a SE pro mod will merge their account with the banned one, and do a whole lot more work which I believe includes <em>also</em> deleting anything (presumably including a question with answers) that the sock created. We've discussed handling this exact situation with SE pro mods and with other mods across the network many times, and account mulching (destruction) is probably the best tool we local site mods have for this situation. Either way, if you respond to them directly, you're likely howling into the void.</p>
<p>In general we don't like to make a big hairy deal about it when this is done, because upsetting people is exactly what a troll wants. Hurting people and shaking up anthills is how they get their jollies. So the quicker and more professionally done, the better.</p>
<p>I will apologize that we didn't manage to identify and mulch that account before you were tricked into responding. Usually we mulch that sock-troll's stuff quite quickly, often in less than an hour, but in this case it appears to have been up for the better part of a day.</p>
<p>It also really sucks that an answer the community seems to have liked (I see it at +5 right now) got caught in the process. I'm not sure this has happened before, so we don't really have a process to cover it. I mean, better to not let the troll's stuff stay up so long in the first place, but we obviously failed there, and if it happened once, its liable to happen again. Perhaps we should discuss how to handle that situation here in case it comes up again? Another meta question specifically on that perhaps?</p>

<p><sup>* - I know this terminology is confusing. It was super confusing to <strong>me</strong> since they both start with &quot;de&quot; and mean roughly the same thing in English. So instead of &quot;destroyed&quot; I prefer to say &quot;mulched&quot;. </sup></p>

So from  this standpoint the most consistent would perhaps be <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/eastern-orthodox-church"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;eastern-orthodox-church&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;eastern-orthodox-church&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""eastern-orthodox-church-container"">eastern-orthodox-church</a></p>

<p>OP's motives aside, it's not clear to me whether this question is &quot;too basic&quot; or not -- The only resource pointed to is an article in the Atlantic Monthly, and I don't consider that a standard reference source.</p>

<p>If they're two things, they need two names. <em>Orthodox Christianity</em> does not work because it could describe mainline Christian beliefs in any denomination - and the history of beliefs-now-held-by-Orthodox-churches would presumably include some heterodox Christians who, broadly speaking, were much closer to beliefs-now-held-by-Orthodox-churches.</p>
<p><em>Eastern Orthodox Christianity</em> also does not work because it excludes beliefs-now-held-by-Orthodox-churches which are not part of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The Ethiopian Orthodox church is an example.</p>
<p>You said that the name was 'non-Standard'. It is not always wrong to call something a different name to what it calls itself. It should only not be done if the name is in some way offensive.</p>
<p>For instance we shouldn't change the Catholicism tag to 'papism', even though 'papism' is shorter, because it is an offensive term. If you can show us someone prominent who says 'don't call our beliefs Orthodoxism, it's offensive', then fine. We will have to come up with something wordier. If not, we should stick with Orthodoxism.</p>

<p>As we say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new one, we have <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=%22year+in+moderation%22+is%3Aquestion"">a tradition of sharing moderation stats for the preceding calendar year</a>.</p>
<p>As most of you here are aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.<br />
-- <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"">A Theory of Moderation</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't eliminate the need for having <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/"">moderators</a> altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.</p>
<p>So as we say goodbye to 2022 (and where did January go, right?) and dive head first into 2023, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/V0TPg.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>exciting</em> stats</a>. Below is a breakdown of moderation actions performed on History over the past 12 months:</p>

<p>² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.</p>
<p>³ A &quot;destroyed&quot; user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user"">Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.</a></p>
<p>⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.</p>
<p>⁵ Includes close flags (but <em>not</em> close or reopen votes). Community can handle these flags by at least one person voting to close a question that has a close flag.</p>
<p>⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.</p>
<p>⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).</p>

[emphasis mine]</strong><br />
           As an FBIS analyst and one of the CIA’s few fluent Chinese linguists, Chin was able to pass along such information as Intelligence Information Reports (IIRs) on China and East Asia, biographical profiles and assessments of fellow CIA employees, and the names and identities of the agency’s covert employees. He was also in a position
to provide information about recruited agents in China.</p>

The opposite is probably more likely - that you're unaware how attractive the topic is to trolls.  We will close the question on a hair trigger, but provide the opportunity for you (in cooperation with the community) to refine the question up to a level of rigor where it is more interesting to serious historians than to trolls.</p>

<p>It was a Latin phrase, consisted—I am quite sure—of three words, and I'm sure it included the word '<em>imitatio</em>'. The meaning was close to &quot;<em>copy, imitate, improve</em>&quot;. I likely encountered it during my Ancient History studies (figuring that might be appropriate here :).</p>

<p>If you think about it, this is asking the users of this site to do research for you that is honestly much better done yourself, since its <em>your</em> memory. Only you know if what is found is correct, and there's even a possibility that you misremembered it beyond all recognition, or dreamt it up, or the person you heard it from did so. Doing the research might tickle your memory a bit to help keep you on the right track, whereas we have no such guides, and indeed no way of knowing if this is even a real thing.</p>
<p>Another large part of the issue is it seems that people who ask questions like this <em>tend to be</em> the same kinds of people who are unable or unwilling to help us out by listing what research they tried and failed; either because they haven't tried any, or because doing research and editing the question to respond to comments would be <em>work</em> and their whole point of asking us was to avoid the work. (I'm not saying <em>you</em> are like this, but that's our experience with others). Either way, this site expects that information in a good question.</p>
<p>So what would a <em>successful</em> such question look like? This is speculation on my part (unless someone can dig up an example of a good one from our site?) but I believe it would have a total information dump of everything the asker can remember about the quote. Where and when it was heard, what context it was used in, what it was explained to them to mean, etc. A lot of that stuff I see above.</p>
<p>It would also list everything the asker already tried to do to track it down themselves, including links, and clues found, and what information was <em>not</em> found there. There would be a decent amount of this (3-ish would be great, but there should be <em>something</em>). This is what I'm not seeing there right now.</p>

place I go when I'm looking for knowledge. Or when I want to create
some.&quot; -- Stephen Colbert.</p>
<p>The History Stack Exchange is supposed to be a high-brow place for
people with an academic interest in history. As such, it's nonsense to
allow answers based on low-quality non-peer reviewed sources like
Wikipedia. The problems with Wikipedia are many and well-documented:</p>
<ul>
<li>It contains numerous inconsistencies, lies by omission, and downright falsehoods.</li>
<li>Nothing on it is attributable to real authors. Writing &quot;according to
Joe Smith 'bla bla'&quot; is materially different from writing &quot;according
to Wikipedia 'bla bla'&quot; because Joe Smith is a real person and you
can check their credentials.</li>
<li>Most significantly: Wikipedia articles change. One article <em>may</em>
have been a good source at one point in time, but many years
later, after the article was rewritten, it may now be terrible.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you as an answerer on History Stack Exchange consider linking to
Wikipedia to get your links-to-text ratio up, pretty please don't do
it. Instead, check what Wikipedia references, read that reference, and
<em>reference that</em>. If you don't have access to that reference or this
is too much work, well then, tough luck, maybe order that reference or
don't write an answer. As a reader of History Stack Exchange, I very
much prefer no references at all over links to Wikipedia
because then I know the author is &quot;winging it&quot;.</p>
<p>If an outright ban is not possible, then perhaps warn answer writers:
&quot;You are linking to Wikipedia which is not a reliable source. Here is
why Wikipedia is not reliable: ...&quot;</p>

<p>First, this question argues for a change without establishing that there is any evidence of a problem.  The question would be stronger if supported by quantified evidence.  What percentage of Wikipedia articles are inaccurate?  What fraction are merely incomplete? What percentage are misinformation rather than legitimate disputes?  Before I endorse  any significant change to the culture of H:SE I'm going to want to understand that.</p>
<p>Second, the question is based on a false premise.  Wikipedia has several quality control features that the question ignores.  Well done Wikipedia pages have references.  Poor quality Wikipedia pages have annotations that invite revisions.  Revisions are subject to a feedback loop.  I'm not sure how effective Wikipedia quality control is, but I'm comfortable that it is stronger than this question assumes.  Ultimately though Wikipedia is a source and history is about assembling a narrative based on existing sources.  The practice of history requires assembling a narrative that accounts for the most evidence and culls the least evidence.  History is about understanding the flaws in the evidence. All sources (including Wikipedia) need to be examined for bias, for flaws, for omissions, and for context.  If history were simply assembling sources like Legos, it wouldn't be very interesting, and it definitely wouldn't be about humanity. Different sources must be treated differently - Oral history is read differently than epigraphy, which is read differently than unreliable sources,  which are read differently than references to unavailable primary sources.  Banning a category of sources simply isn't the way I understand history to be practiced.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Yes, Wikipedia contains many inconsistencies, omissions and falsehoods. Like any other source. The number of people participating in many pre-modern battles exceeds the population of the participating countries.  IIRC, a similar statistic was generated for the US civil war based on monument inscriptions. We have records that state that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_II_of_England#Controversies"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Edward II of England</a> died on several different dates and that he lived long after those dates in exile.  We have multiple records with multiple conflicting explanations for most historical phenomenon (the Great Depression, for example).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Many sources cannot be attributed to real authors.  The books of the Christian Bible were probably not authored by the listed authors.  The Federalist papers were not authored by a person named Publius.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Yes, Wikipedia articles change; many modern, internet based sources change (that is a feature, not a bug; science is a process, not a product) a <a href=""https://www.scribbr.com/citing-sources/how-to-cite-wikipedia/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">well cited</a> article will indicate the date of the citation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the real problem is not Wikipedia, but upvotes on substandard answers, then banning Wikipedia won't solve the problem.  The problem is voting. voting is a very rough indicator of quality. I don't think many will defend voting,  since it was discovered that Fastest Gun In the Internet was a relatively sure-fire way to build rep.  Voting is flawed. The flaw has nothing to do with Wikipedia, it has to do with human psychology, and I don't propose to change that.</p>
<p>Just because we're working in text, which can fail to convey nuance, I want to hasten to point out that I'm glad you asked the question - I disagree with the conclusions, but I appreciate the fact that you raised the question, and I hope that others will weigh in to support, or to provide new, alternative perspectives.</p>

comments are a form of trolling. I wrote about this years ago on
Stackoverflow and I believe it applies to History SE too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think a lot of users, perhaps particularly those with lots of
points, should consider whether their comments and up and down-votes
are productive or not. Am I commenting because I hope to get up
votes?  Because I felt someone attacked me and I need to defend
myself? Is it really telling the asker of the question something
they didn't already know? For some people it feels good to be on the
majority's side. Especially if there is someone agitated on the
contrarian side. Thus, you have situations wherein five diferent
people explain to someone asking a question what's wrong with
it. Four of those explanations may be redundant, but they all felt
good when posting them so that's why they are there.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the moderators could police comments more? If someone has a
history of posting snarky, rude, or incivil questions the moderators
could warn them or remove their commenting privileges if they fail
to behave nicely? Perhaps remove the ability to upvote comments to
remove one of the incentives of posting &quot;piling on&quot; comments?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So my suggested remedy is stricter commenting policies. Us normal
users can also help by flagging more comments as either &quot;unkind&quot; or
&quot;redundant&quot;, but it doesn't always get them removed.</p>

<p>To the extent that this strike is about AI, I'm not sure that it is relevant to H:SE.  I predict that for the vast majority of the cases, I can moderate content based on the quality of the content, the presence of preliminary research, the presence/absence of citations, etc.   Whether or not the content is written by AI isn't likely to be the determining factor. Although SE didn't present evidence (Had their post been in this community, it would have fallen short of the &quot;preliminary research test&quot;), I am sufficiently skeptical of AI and concerned about the implications for diversity that arise from suppressing AI.</p>
<p>To the extent that this strike is about SE corporate culture, I'm not convinced that a strike is the right approach.  I agree that SE is failing to build the kind of trust that supports the community they claim to want.  Their language can be absolutist/autocratic/insensitive.  On the other hand, I strongly suspect that they're working under legal/regulatory/governance constraints that I don't fully understand, and I'm reluctant to hold them  accountable without understanding those constraints.</p>
<p>I'm not optimistic about the future of SE.  At a minimum, SE is going to transform as it matures - all institutions grow from gardens of hope to edifices of routine.  The effort to generate value and sustain investment requires culling opportunities.  Creating an institution requires transforming tribal joy into routine procedure, but also inevitable captures and preserves all the errors made.  Tomorrow's SE will be different from today's, less in some ways, more in others.</p>
<p>But like T.E.D. the joy I derive is from supporting this site, these people, this topic. I'm not responsible for the bigger picture.  SE is aware that they've failed to capture my trust and loyalty.</p>

We could also tackle questions on the historical trend of immigrants to various countries adopting (or not) localized versions of their names upon immigration (e.g. Petrovich to Peters or Janssen to Johnson), but probably could not comment on the motivations (or lack thereof) of your specific non-notable ancestor who may or may not have changed their name at some point.</p>

<p>I'd like to seek clarification on the closure of <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/71772/why-didnt-a-noble-family-change-their-last-name-from-a-kind-of-duck-to-somethin"">this</a> question about Nikolai Gogol and his family name. It was closed for being primarily opinion-based, but I'm uncertain about the reasoning behind it.</p>
<p>First of all, prior to posting the question to the main site, the OP <a href=""https://history.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4450/is-asking-about-the-reason-an-old-noble-family-chose-their-last-name-on-topic-he"">created a meta-question</a> to ask whether it would be on-topic. That, as far as I know, is <em>incredibly</em> rare. (If only all first-time askers did that!) Both of the answers to the meta-question indicate that, yes, asking about this would be on-topic.</p>
<p>Secondly, the question, when asked on the main site, was pretty well-received- it made the HNQ and got at least 6 upvotes (I don't have the see-vote-breakdown privilege yet). The question includes some prior research/effort on the OP's part and isn't one of those crappy one-line '<a href=""https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/209913/what-do-you-call-a-qa-user-who-posts-a-question-but-never-checks-back"">ask-and-dash</a>' posts.</p>
<p>The boilerplate close notice for opinion-based is '<em>This question is likely to be answered with opinions rather than facts and citations</em>'. But...the question <em>was</em> answered non-subjectively with two linked sources that explicitly examined what had been asked; it was answered with 'facts and citations' well before it was closed. Sure, the answer <em>kind of</em> refutes the premise, but it evidently satisfied the OP's doubts.</p>
<p>(I understand that it is currently in review and has two reopen votes)</p>
<hr />
<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What made it opinion-based?</li>
<li>Is it salvageable?</li>
<li>Are there any similar questions on this site that were closed for the 'q is subjective' reason that can be pointed to as precedent for this one?</li>
</ul>
<p>(This post is a mix of challenging the closure and finding an explanation for it.)</p>

<p>More generally, it seems like its looking for one little damning snippet of information, rather than enlightenment on the subject. It might be a good idea to try to level that out a bit?</p>
<hr />
<p>I will add though that I have a personal historical hobby horse on this subject. You can see <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/16774/is-there-any-evidence-of-post-landbridge-travel-across-the-bering-strait/16790#16790"">I've written about it before</a>, so yes I fully understand that land bridges are not required for modern humans.</p>
<p>Due to that part of my heritage, I hang out in a lot of online places where Native Americans exchange ideas. There's one revisionist strain I bump into a lot, where people like to construct a &quot;Bering Land Bridge Theory&quot; as a strawman to pound the stuffing out of. There seems to be no end to the new finds that people can tout as destroying this imaginary theory. I'm sure that's cathartic, but its also bogus. You can search <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopling_of_the_Americas"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Wikipedia page on this subject</a> in vain for that phrase. Everyone who seriously studies this issue knows that boats <em>are used</em> in Beringia, and <em>were used</em> historically.</p>
<p>There is a theory that one particular migration may have used a temporary ice-free corridor between the Alaskan glaciers rather than boats. These theories are called &quot;coastal migration&quot; vs. &quot;interior migration&quot;. But there's no good way to prove either of them aside from circumstantial evidence of timing. We just have really good evidence that at least one of the two happened.</p>
<p>The point of all this is that this particular subject quite often has people looking to beat up on a strawman they heard about, rather than honestly asking for info.</p>

<p>In my opinion neither <code>Russia</code>, nor <code>medieval-Russia</code> are fit there. I don't think that a <code>kievan-rus</code> tag is useless, it even can contribute to avoid such dilemmas.</p>
<p>— Just as <code>medieval-russia</code> tag relates to a sub-category of the larger category tagged <code>russia</code>, and can only be used about Russia if a question is about its medieval period, because <em>a specific tag cannot be applied to a question too general for it</em>, a tag referring to &quot;Russia&quot; (medieval or not) should be seen as too specific when the question is very generally about Kievan Rus (like the above is).</p>
<p>That should depend on the question, of course, and for that very reason, considering the specific question linked above, I argue that it is too general for tags like &quot;Russia&quot; or &quot;Ukraine&quot;, be they medieval or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <em>nation's history began with that of the East Slavs, who emerged as
a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries</em> AD.
Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants,
the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted
Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning <em>the
synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian
culture for the next millennium.</em> Rus' <em>ultimately disintegrated</em> into a
number of smaller states; most of the Rus' lands were overrun by the
Mongol invasion and became tributaries of the nomadic Golden Horde.
<em>The Grand Duchy of Moscow gradually reunified the surrounding Russian
principalities, achieved independence from the Golden Horde, and came
to dominate the cultural and political legacy of Kievan Ru</em>s'. By the
18th century, the nation had greatly expanded through conquest,
annexation, and exploration to become the Russian Empire...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have marked in italics the parts that seem biased to me.</p>
<p>Shouldn't &quot;Russia&quot; tag, just like tags for &quot;Ukraine&quot;, &quot;France&quot;, or &quot;Italy&quot;, or &quot;Romania&quot;, be defined based on a &quot;beginning&quot; in history that represents the <em>specific difference</em> that makes that defined name necessary? (&quot;Russia&quot; is not at all a word needed to  name the specific difference made by the Scandinavian lords of Kiev and their Slavic people becoming Christians.)</p>
<p>That should be a matter-of-fact definition, and not an essentialist-ideological one, where the history of France starts with the Roman conquest of Gauls, or with Celts coming into that area (or history of Romania starting with the conquest of Dacia, or maybe with Burebista unifying Dacians in one kingdom...) etc.</p>
<p>That &quot;info&quot; rather clearly puts forward that Kievan Rus disintegrated and was conquered by the Mongols, while the Duchy of Muscovy <em>restored</em> it and beat the Mongols – and even that the following expansion came as a continuation of the same process - in a loosely connected action of &quot;conquest, annexation, and exploration&quot;. (That's probably meant in the same sense in which West European powers &quot;explored&quot; parts of Africa and Asia, incidentally &quot;annexing&quot; them and - why not - conquering them. - The main difference being those empires are mostly not here anymore, and thus even suggesting that the French &quot;explored&quot; Africa seems a bit ridiculous now.
That is how Russian nationalists describe their own country, but not how an empire should be described on stackexchange.)</p>

<p>So the issue here is really that we are getting questions about the area (which is now of great international interest due to the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war) and our available tag selection is a bit weak.</p>

<p><em>This tag already exists</em> (so this is a status-quo/retagging option), and has 46 questions on it. However, its just as anachronistic in the general case as <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/russia"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;russia&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;russia&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-russia-tooltip-container"">russia</a>.</p>

<p>The drawback is that there is a 200+ year temporal hole between where the Kievan Rus state wasn't really Norse at all anymore, and its destruction at the hands of the Mongols. So while it theoretically could be useful in the example, it won't be useful in the general case of questions about the Kievan Rus.</p>
<p>I found 5 existing questions that used the word and 19 answers, which doesn't quite scream &quot;this needs a tag&quot;, but it wouldn't be ridiculously niche either.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kievan-rus"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;kievan-rus&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;kievan-rus&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-kievan-rus-tooltip-container"">kievan-rus</a> : A state-based term.</li>
</ul>
<p>This would nicely give us temporal coverage for about 400 years over the areas and peoples that immediately afterwards could sport <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/russia"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;russia&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;russia&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-russia-tooltip-container"">russia</a> and <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ukraine"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ukraine&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;ukraine&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-ukraine-tooltip-container"">ukraine</a>.</p>
<p>The drawback here is it leaves a lot of those Varangian questions uncovered. In particular, I'd say 2 of the 5, with 2 more being debatable.</p>
<p>I found 7 questions containing this phrase, and 30 answers.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/rus"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;rus&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;rus&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-rus-tooltip-container"">rus</a> : A people/cultrual based term.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is more talking about the people, but that means its temporal coverage is much greater than if we were merely tagging the Kievan Rus' state. It could arguably be applied to almost all Varangian questions as well. With a bit of stretching, it could probably be pressed into service for linguistic questions about the Old East Slavic language.</p>
<p>The big drawback I see here is that this tag is likely to confuse both users and our  tag completion software, since we already have a <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/russia"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;russia&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;russia&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-russia-tooltip-container"">russia</a>. &quot;rus&quot; already has 13 possible suggested completions (7 of which are Russia-adjacent).</p>
<p>I found 23 existing questions that used the term (17 open), and 22 answers. Rather a lot of these at first glance look like they would be considered mis-tagged (anachronistic uses of <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/russia"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;russia&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;russia&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-russia-tooltip-container"">russia</a> or <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ukraine"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ukraine&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;ukraine&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-ukraine-tooltip-container"">ukraine</a>, using nation-based tags for peoples, etc.) I'm not sure if that's an argument for or against this as a tag.</p>

<p>While the rulers of this state were initially Norse Varangians, the basal population were <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Slavic_language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">proto-Slavic</a>-speaking. After a couple of centuries, so were the rulers. This set these peoples off into their own cultural path, resulting in their language separating from the rest of Late proto-Slavic. We call the new language these (Rus') peoples spoke <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_East_Slavic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Old East Slavic</a>.</p>
<p>In 1240 the Kievan Rus' state was destroyed by the Mongols. The eastern portions ended up subjects of the Golden Horde, while the western portions of it eventually ended up bundled up into the expanding joint kingdoms of Poland-Lithuania. This split the cultural areas up into two, where the languages evolved into <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruthenian_language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ruthenian</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Russian_language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Russian</a><sup>2</sup>. Ruthenian in the mid-modern period split into Ukrainian, Belorussian, and Rusyn.

<h2>History of Russian Cultural Imperialism</h2>
<p>From nearly the moment the Russians threw off the tartar yoke, their leaders began <a href=""https://kyivindependent.com/kyivan-rus-then-and-now/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">styling themselves as the true natural successors of the medieval Rus'</a> people, effectively erasing the separate existence and history of the Ruthenians and their descendants. Here's a bit of detail from a Ukrainian source:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1547, Ivan IV of Moscow, known later as Ivan the Terrible, was
crowned Tsar of all Rus, despite having no control over most of the
former Kyivan Rus principalities that became a part of the Grand Duchy
of Lithuania. The name Tsardom of Russia became interchangeable with
that of the Tsardom of Muscovy.</p>
<p>On Oct. 22, 1721, Russian Tsar Peter officially changed the country's
name from the Tsardom of Russia to the Russian Empire, thus fully
appropriating the name of Kyivan Rus and shaping its imperial
identity. He also proclaimed himself as the emperor of all of Russia.</p>
<p>A couple of decades later, Catherine the Great would see an urgent
need to write a new version of Russian history, fueled by the rapid
expansion of the Russian Empire during her reign.</p>
<p>On Dec. 4, 1783, Catherine issued an order to set up a &quot;Commission for
making notes about ancient history, mostly of Russia,&quot; which was
tasked with fulfilling her vision of history. This version effectively
proclaimed the Russian Empire as the successor to Kyivan Rus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Russian sources, when Ruthenian-speaking peoples were mentioned, they were instead just given adjective terms as other lesser kinds of Russians. &quot;White&quot; for Belarusians, and &quot;Little&quot; for Ukrainians. Russia itself of course in this context called itself &quot;Great&quot;. Due perhaps to the close ties between Russian and English royal families, or perhaps to the Russians being the only ones of the 3 with their own state, English has had a tendency to accept this Russian framing.</p>
<p>This Russian tendency to see themselves as the only true heirs to the Rus' has taken on a decidedly sinister aspect in the last few years. The head of the Russian state had made statements <a href=""https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lseih/2020/07/01/there-is-no-ukraine-fact-checking-the-kremlins-version-of-ukrainian-history/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">denying the existence of any Ukrainian national identity</a>, and has taken steps to destroy it both <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">politically</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abductions_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ethnically</a>. The latter currently has garnered him an <a href=""https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-ukraine-icc-judges-issue-arrest-warrants-against-vladimir-vladimirovich-putin-and"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">international arrest warrant</a> on war crimes charges.</p>
<h2>History.SE stance</h2>
<p>While there's arguably a difference of opinion here, and English has historically sided with the Russian position, I don't think that's a good argument for continuing to do so. There's no logical reason why the Russian language and culture should be considered privileged over that of Kiev itself (Ukrainian), or even over that of Belarus, as a successor culture to the Kievan Rus' and their Old East Slavic language. We don't consider Spanish to be the one true successor to Latin and the Roman Empire, over and above French, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian, just because there are far more Spanish-speakers running around today than the rest combined.</p>
<p>I'd also argue that continuing to do so today would be immoral. No matter your feelings in the linguistic/propaganda dispute, <strong>we do not want to see this site take a stance that provides aid and comfort to the perpetrators of Genocide</strong>. Personally, I won't do it, and I'd like to think the vast majority of the users of this site (not to mention <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/conduct/political-speech"">the StackExchange network itself</a>) are with me on that.</p>
<p>So given the above, <strong>yes the current wording of the Russian tag needs to be fixed.</strong> I'll post a suggestion as a separate wiki answer, to encourage friendly edits.</p>
<p>In addition, I'm noticing that the tag usage guidance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The largest country in the world, spanning territory from the eastern
edge of Europe to Siberia in northern Asia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>... is completely devoid of any usage guidance. That needs to be fixed as well.</p>
<p>The last paragraph contains various international rankings and organizations, which is now 11 years later wildly out of date (largely due to the shrinking international standing of the Russian Federation). Also, the 4th paragraph containing one good piece of alternate tagging advice could use some expansion.</p>
<hr />
<p><sup>1 - In fact, the first known use of the term was a 1921 OED reference to &quot;cultural imperialism of the Russians&quot;</sup></p>
<p><sup>2 - I just say &quot;Russian&quot; because the periodization of the language across time is still under dispute, for reasons that may become clear later in this post.</sup></p>

</blockquote>
<p>My feeling is that the mere mention of a current event within my post triggered the quick responses and that an actual read-through of the question, or even the title itself would have been enough to dispel the concern.</p>
<p>I'm literally asking for history here, but I'm explaining why I'm asking. <em>Is that the problem?</em>  Should we always avoid even mentioning or citing the present within a question post?</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>title:</strong> Historical instances of campaigns for elected law enforcement positions where candidate runs on &quot;out to get person X&quot; as major part of their message?</p>
<p>The motivation of my question is to explore the history of elected US officials who run &quot;out to get X&quot; campaigns. What got me interested is the following quote from CNN's October 3, 2023 <a href=""https://youtu.be/hkcvk8K0-4g?t=47"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Judge rebuts attacks from Trump's attorney in $250M civil case
</a> where the (quite famous) former US president states to the press outside the courtroom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have a racist Attorney General who's a horror show, <strong>who ran on the basis that she was going to get Trump</strong> before she even know anything about me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For any literate person not to &quot;know anything about&quot; the defendant here is more than unlikely, but the idea of running a campaign based on &quot;going to get&quot; someone is interesting.</p>
<p>Have there been <strong>other, historical instances of campaigns</strong> for elected law enforcement positions where a candidate has run on &quot;out to get person X&quot; as a major part of their message?</p>
<p>Are such campaigns extremely few and been widely seen has personal vendettas, or have they perhaps been an accepted platform from time to time as certain public figures become recognized as &quot;untouchable criminals&quot; in need of being &quot;gotten&quot;?</p>

<p>History is about facts. This is fiction. This is a hoax, a fraud, and should be immediately destroyed and removed from the internet. Removed from this site.</p>
<p>Historians are in a war every day to prevent lies from being established on the internet as 'truth'. AI generates lies that are difficult for the common person to distinguish from the truth. The very existence of this fake image on this site has already been absorbed by the search engines as 'fact'. But its a lie, a fraud, a hoax. It degrades the very nature of the world we live in by filling it with more lies. We have enough politicians and trolls trying to do this already...</p>
<p>So yes, creating a fraudulent image passing it off as a historical person is immoral.</p>
<hr />
<p>(I can not speak to the accuracy of this image or its utility as a possible 'artists impression' since we have no information concerning the tools used to create it.)</p>
<p>Images generated by AI art are fascinating, and can be quite interesting, but the result is completely based on the model being used and the prompt being fed into that model. It in no way will perform any reasoning, thought, or artistry to create an image, it is merely a reorganization of material it has viewed during the AI models training process. Note the two watch chains on this image-it copied from two existing images  somewhere, each of which had a watch chain in different locations, so without proper negative prompting it generated two watch chains in this image. This reiterates the copycat nature of this tool.</p>
<p>As I stated above, the danger here is that this image, like many AI generated answers, looks close enough to be considered valid. In these days of web scrapers gathering information, search engines fighting to introduce AIs which not only perform searches, but try to present answers to queries placed in their search bar, it is inevitable that, even if the OP clearly states the image is not real, it will be taken out of context and presented as fact by a search engine somewhere, and someone will believe it.</p>
<p>(As a side note, I will point out that I am not speaking from complete ignorance. I have 'tinkered' with AI art generation for in excess of 100 hours, generated hundreds of images, so have at least a basic understanding (I hope) of the processes involved.)</p>

You can see a lot of illustrations and statues of medieval and older kings whose likeness is absolutely unknown, and catholic and orthodox churches are full with conventional images of saints from nearly 2000 years ago. Nothing of that is immoral because the viewer knows that the image is just imaginary and only conveys the artist's ideas about the subject - which can actually be quite useful in its context.</p>
<p>Therefore, it's not immoral to post such an AI generated image as long as it's made clear to the viewer that it's just imaginary.</p>
<p>That problem doesn't show up just in history: it is very common in astronomy, and serious publishers of popular science are very consistent in labelling as &quot;artist's impression&quot; any image that could be misunderstood by an uneducated reader as a photograph.</p>

<p>Many people on the network confuse tag wikis with &quot;a place to define the word in the tag&quot;. This was never the purpose of tag wikis. Stackexchange Meta <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/214337/what-is-a-tag-wiki-how-do-i-write-a-good-one"">has guidance</a> on how to write (and not write) tag wikis. Relevant parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Avoid generically defining the concept behind a tag, unless it is highly specialized. The “email” tag, for example, does not need to explain what email is.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Concentrate on what a tag means to your community. For “email” on Server Fault, mention the server aspects of email including POP3, SMTP, IMAP, and server software. For “email” on Super User, mention desktop email clients and explicitly exclude webmail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tags only exist as ways of organizing questions [...] if the tag is common knowledge [...] don’t bother explaining the tag at all</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Currently, the whole tag wiki consists of a litany of statements about Russia as a country. Based on my experience as a Stackexchange user, site moderator and sometime-taxonomist, <em>all of the current text should be removed completely</em>. Surely, people know that Russia is a country in Northern Eurasia, and if they want to look up how many federal districts it has or which government form it had in a given century, they would do so in an encyclopedia, not in the largely hidden taxonomist's help notes of a Q&amp;A site.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that the controversy can be avoided. There likely is a need to define when questions should get the tag <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/russia"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;russia&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;russia&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-russia-tooltip-container"">russia</a> and when <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kyievan-rus"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;kyievan-rus&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;kyievan-rus&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-kyievan-rus-tooltip-container"">kyievan-rus</a>. So there probably is a need to state something on the lines of &quot;Any questions for events in the Dniepr basin up to 1240 should be tagged <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/kyievan-rus"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;kyievan-rus&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;kyievan-rus&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-kyievan-rus-tooltip-container"">kyievan-rus</a> and not <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/russia"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;russia&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;russia&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-russia-tooltip-container"">russia</a>&quot;. (This is an example; the frequent site users here should decide where to draw the line, and not I). But in a tag wiki, there should be only a few lines of tag distinctionAny longer information should be related to common misuses of the tag, and possibly details about the site's scope, if needed (e.g. &quot;Please do not ask questions about Russian folk tales under this tag, since folk tales are off topic for our site&quot;).

<p><strong>Automatic bans never expire or &quot;time out&quot;</strong>. This means that you cannot
simply wait for a certain amount of time. If you do not take action,
you will never be allowed to freely post again. The only way for the
ban to be lifted is by contributing positively to the site in other
ways.</p>
<p>Moderators cannot lift the ban.</p>
<p>Before you do anything else, fix your existing posts! As noted above,
downvotes cast by the rest of the community factor into the ban - so
the single best thing you can do to get it lifted is to address any
objections raised by others. Were your past questions unclear? Did
they fail to show any effort on your part? Poorly worded, titled,
formatted, and overly long or short? Then fix them!</p>
<p>Note the emphasis on fixing. Do not delete your posts. As explained
above, negative marks on deleted posts do still count towards the
question ban, and the fact that they are deleted can also count
against you (with the exception of questions that are 30 days or older
when deleted). Deleting your posts does not help to lift the ban. Only
fixing does! You can see a list of your own deleted questions and
answers.</p>
<p>Do note that rewriting an existing question into a substantially
different question is frowned upon. Your edits should not negate or
invalidate existing answers. The fixed post should fundamentally be
about the same issue and topic, and the existing answers should still
apply to it.</p>
<p>If you're blocked from asking questions and are unable to improve your
existing questions (or your existing questions are all deleted),
you'll get the chance to post one new question 6 months after your
last question. Your block will still remain once that question is
posted, but a single positively-received question could be enough to
lift you out of the block. (This does not apply to answer bans.)</p>
<p>If you are banned from asking questions, then writing a few quality
answers that get upvoted might enable you to ask questions again. But
as the internals of the filter are secret, there is no way to know for
sure.</p>
<p>If you really, really think the ban is an error, then email the team
directly using the &quot;contact us&quot; link provided at the bottom of every
page. But note that reactivation of banned accounts is not a high
priority.</p>

<p>I wonder whether the correct thing is to edit the answer (like the user did in this case) or simply delete it and write a new one (but nobody wants to lose the votes). Because the votes where given to the original answer, not the edited one.</p>
<p>Probably this won't be a singular case. Many historical events (or events that are still in the territory of journalism) that get new information are going to suffer drastic changes while the time passes by.</p>

The biggest one I can think of off the top of my head was <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/46658/did-china-ever-consider-a-phonetic-writing-system/46659#46659"">this answer about alternate Chinese writing systems</a>. It was the accepted answer to the question for half a decade, with a score considerably north of 100.</p>
<p>Then I found out a couple of months ago, while researching another question, that the top line <strong>boldfaced</strong> conclusion/answer was in fact 180° <em>wrong</em>. Like super wrong. Not &quot;I don't think the logic holds&quot; wrong, but factually incorrect<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>That's seriously embarrassing. However, even more embarrassing once I know its wrong would be continuing to leave that highly voted answer I know is wrong up there, getting accolades and spreading its wrongness around. So there was nothing for it; it <strong>had</strong> to be fixed.</p>
<p>Fortunately in this case, most of the discourse in the answer still applied. So I could just edit the answer to feature the Phagpa Script, turn the conclusion logic around, and leave it be.</p>
<p>I know in some cases even a fix that drastic won't do, or in fairness the other text everyone voted for should probably remain up. In the past I've handled that by chucking in a horizontal line and some &quot;update&quot; text at the end with the new information. Like so:</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>I could also see a case for making yourself a new completely separate answer. The problem is the OQ years later isn't likely hanging out looking to revise their checkmark. Still, that's arguably morally superior to completely changing the text in an accepted answer, leaving accepted something that's nothing like what the OQ thought they were accepting.</p>
<p>There's also another principle that should probably be brought up here: I believe strongly that a poster should have the right to not have words they deem morally objectionable posted on this site with their name next to them. This has come up before in the context of removing a Muslim users' &quot;PBUM&quot; honorific around religious leaders.</p>
<p>It can also be relevant in cases where someone has posted what they later come to realize was genocide-encouraging propaganda (denying a state or a peoples' existence). That appears to be what happened here in this 2014 Ukraine answer.<sup>2</sup> So in this case, yes I think the poster's right to not have words they find morally repulsive sitting there with their authorship tag on them trumps other considerations. If the rest of us think that turns the answer into some kind of problem, we can discuss that.</p>

<p><sup>1 - The next highest answer had actually mentioned this script, but at the time I'd dismissed it as something used by only by Mongols, not something they were seriously trying to replace Hanzi with. My apologies to user lly.</sup></p>
<p><sup>2 - I have a similar answer about how Crimea came to be Ukranian that has been bugging me for years. Its still factually correct, so I can't justify changing it, but I'm not a fan of its implication that Ukraine somehow didn't earn Crimea. My fault I guess for answering with the naive mindset that borders are sacrosanct now, and it was just a historical curiosity.</sup></p>

Having decided to do that, I'm going to advance a strawman counter-argument. I'm not sure how committed I am to the counterargument, but I think the exercise of exploration is worth it.  So not only is this not a mod's opinion, but it may not even be my personal opinion for very long....</p>
<p>The rest of SE has ceased to hold my interest; 99% of my participation is on H:SE these days because it is the only site that seems to do anything other than ping pong between trivial questions and incredibly abstruse questions.  So when I say that H:SE is &quot;unique&quot; I'm aware that I'm coming from a very shallow place.</p>
<p>History is a science; it progresses through hypothesis and evidence. It is based on a formalism.  In this it is like other scientific sites - like programming language where it is impolite to post a question like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;how do I write hello world&quot;
Like those sites, courtesy and respect for the time and effort of others require  that you show an effort to solve a problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But History is not a technical/engineering site.  Unlike a coding site the rhythm isn't to provide draft code and request diagnosis.</p>
<p>At first glance, the challenge in history is twofold:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Knowing the right way to ask the question/right question to ask.  Frequently the key to unlocking an answer is to figure out the right terms to search (I'm pretty sure the current question about &quot;Contested US elections&quot; is an example - had the question been asked about &quot;challenged US elections&quot; it might have passed.  I've been dying to ask a question about the role of the horse in trade on the silk road. What was the total value of horses traded through the silk road? Who were the trading partners?  How were markets formed and closed?  That cluster of questions needs to be refined.  I'm not even ready to post it in the hopes that someone will provide a clarifying comment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Knowing the right source.  Sometimes you understand the question, and you've exhausted all the resources, and you don't know where to go next.  I'd love to know how frequently thumb rings were used by archers in the hundred years war (and by what route they migrated to that war).  In only one source have I read about English archers in the hundred years war using thumb rings (rather than a three finger draw).  Before I ask it, I want to go back and check to see if the error is in my memory or in the sources (and consult the two new sources on my bookshelf).  When I have done that I'll be thrilled if someone can suggest a new source.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>IMHO, both of those are examples where a well formed comment is fantastically helpful, but is not an &quot;answer&quot;.  Would the site be improved if all those hints/suggestions were moved from ephemeral comments to permanent partial/unsatisfactory/unacceptable &quot;answers&quot;??</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>I</p>
